// Integration-test fixture for the hub-agent deploy-flow surface.
//
// Spins up a real hub WebSocket server, a mock inference HTTP server, and
// a real sidecar subprocess wired to the hub. The fixture owns the full
// lifecycle: tempdir allocation, hub initialization, mock-inference boot,
// sidecar process spawn, stderr drain, and teardown of every resource.
//
// Tests use the fixture as:
//
//   let env: DeployFlowEnv;
//
//   beforeAll(async () => {
//     env = await startDeployFlowEnv();
//   });
//
//   afterAll(async () => {
//     await env.teardown();
//   });
//
// The fixture exposes the hub handle, the inference request capture, the
// sidecar process handle, and a `sidecarDiagnostics()` callback that
// surfaces sidecar stderr and hub state-pack receive failures. A wait helper
// given a `timeoutMs` renders it when that bound lapses; `teardown()` renders
// it when a wait is still in flight, which is what a wedged test leaves
// behind, and then stops that wait so it does not poll on into the env
// teardown is dismantling (see the in-flight wait registry below).
//
// Shared constants
// ----------------
// AGENT_ADDRESS, AGENT_ID, SESSION_ID, SIDECAR_ID, TOKEN are exported so
// tests that exercise the same agent across multiple lifecycle steps can
// reuse them without re-declaring.

// tempdirs teardown has already dismantled, and the fault it eventually hits
// is a fault of the dismantling, not of the test: a read through
// `requireDeployment` after `deployments.clear()` reports that a test forgot
// to register its deployment. Bun charges that rejection to whichever test is
// running when it settles, so the report names an innocent test or no test at
// all. `stopOutstandingWaits` ends the loop at its next iteration instead,
// with an error that says what actually happened.
//
// The registry is module-scoped because `waitFor` takes no env, so an
// abandoned record outlives the file that made it (`--no-isolate` keeps one
// module registry per worker across that worker's files). `currentWaitMark`
// fences that off: an env reports and stops only registrations at or after

 * unresolved; an unbounded wait there wedged the afterAll hook until the whole

 * data directory keeps the earlier fix intact: removing `sidecar-data-*` while
 * a subprocess still holds file handles raced EBUSY/EACCES on slow hosts, so
 * errors must surface from the rm rather than be shrouded.
 *
 * The subtree reap closes the second half of the sidecar leak: killing the
 * sidecar orphans its workflow-process children. They normally notice the dead
 * host through their broken IPC channel and exit on their own, but under load
 * that has been observed to take tens of seconds, and each straggler holds
 * ~300MB of RSS plus its OS file handles into the next test file's boot,
 * inflating the pass's peak RSS. The descendants are snapshotted *before* the
 * kill: once the sidecar exits, the kernel re-parents its children to init
 * and they can no longer be attributed to it.
 *
 * Safe to call twice on the same handle (crash tests terminate the sidecar
 * mid-test, then `teardown()` terminates it again): `proc.kill()` is a no-op
 * and `proc.exited` is already resolved on a finished subprocess, and a
 * subtree walk from a dead pid finds nothing.

// its own workflow and no test re-triggers a completed deployment after a
// later deploy in the same file -- so killing its child is unobservable to
