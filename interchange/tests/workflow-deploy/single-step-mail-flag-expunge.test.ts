// Single-step warm-agent flag + expunge round-trip (INTR-480).
//
// Proves that the warm single-step agent consumes a message end-to-end: it
// flags an inbound mail \Deleted through `mail_flag`, then removes it with
// `mail_expunge`, and the change lands in the deployment's durable substrate
// mailbox on the hub. Both tools route through the supervisor -- the sole
// mailbox writer -- so this exercises the whole chain: agent tool -> child
// mailbox-mutation bridge -> supervisor apply + flush -> pack-push to the hub.
//
// The test carries TWO inbound messages so it can prove the expunge sweep is
// \Deleted-SELECTIVE, not a blanket wipe -- which is what makes the routed
// read-your-writes claim unconditional. The scripted mock provider drives the
// loop deterministically inside ONE run:
//   turn 0: mail_wait for mail 2's sender -- blocks the run.
//   turn 1 (after mail 2 arrives): mail_flag mail 1 (uid 1) \Deleted.
//   turn 2: mail_expunge -- sweeps every \Deleted message from INBOX.
//   turn 3: a closing text turn, which ends the run.
// Mail 1 is the first message, so the supervisor's eager-commit assigns it
// uid 1 -- the static ref the flag turn targets. Mail 2, delivered while the
// run blocks in mail_wait, eager-commits as uid 2 and is never flagged.
//
// Assertions, read off the hub's replicated workflow-run repo:
//   * The committed `mailbox/INBOX/index.json` holds exactly the UNFLAGGED
//     uid 2: the expunge removed uid 1 (\Deleted) and left uid 2. This only
//     holds if the sweep observed the flag mail_flag wrote AND honored it
//     selectively -- the routed read-your-writes. uidNext stayed at 3, so the
//     mailbox was never reset.
//   * The `1.eml` blob is ABSENT from the tip tree (physically expunged) but
//     still reachable through an ancestor commit: the audit bytes survive in
//     git history, not the live tree. `2.eml` remains in the tip tree.
//   * The `mail_wait` tool_result the agent answered carries mail 2's sender,
//     which is what proves mail 2's arrival woke the wait rather than the wait
//     expiring on its own timer.
