// Federated deliver path: an agent-to-deployment mail run reaches SUCCESS.
//
// The runId contract has TWO grants writers. The hub-api trigger route is
// covered by `mail-trigger-run-completes-real-route`; this test covers the
// OTHER one: the sidecar's `deliverMailToRecipient`, which materializes a
// receiving deployment's grants when a `mail.outbound` frame (an agent
// sending mail to a workflow deployment) names it. That path derives the
// receiving run's runId from the RECIPIENT address, stages the run's grants
// at `runs/<recipientAddress>/grants.json`, and the supervisor's onRunStart
// barrier reads exactly that path -- so a producer that keys by the mail's
// Message-ID leaves the barrier's path empty and the run fails closed.
//
// One hub, TWO sidecars, one deployment on each -- the sidecar split is
// load-bearing. A mail send is only remote (and so only leaves as a
// `delivered:false` frame that reaches deliverMailToRecipient) when the
// recipient is not registered on the SENDER's own transport; co-locating both
// deployments on one sidecar makes the send local and never exercises the path
// under test.
//   - Deployment B (the RECEIVER) is a completing echo agent on sidecar 2. It
//     is NEVER triggered by the fixture, so its grants come ONLY from the
//     sidecar's real materializer -- if that stages them under the wrong
//     runId, B's onRunStart finds no grants file and B fails closed. B
//     reaching RunCompleted is therefore the whole proof. Its grants come from
//     the frozen grant snapshot the source-ref deploy's approve step wrote.
//   - Deployment A (the SENDER) is on sidecar 1 and its agent carries the
//     inline `mail_send` tool from the `mail-tool.ts` fixture in its transport
//     variant; its mock inference calls it with `to: <B's address>`, so A's run
//     forwards a real `mail.outbound` frame to the hub, which routes it through
//     `handleMailOutbound -> deliverMailToRecipient(B)`.
//
// The REAL `createMailTriggeredRunGrantsMaterializer` (backed by a migrated
// schema) is wired into the fixture hub's sidecar router via the
// `materializeMailTriggeredRunGrants` option, closing the harness gap that let
// the earlier route test assert only DB rows.
//
// SCOPE: this exercises the RECEIVER seam -- grant materialization + the
// onRunStart barrier -- across a real sidecar transport on ONE hub. It is NOT
// cross-hub coverage: the sender-to-receiver hop stays inside a single hub's
// router, not over a hub-link between two hubs. A dedicated two-hub
// federation-transport test is separate and non-gating; do not read this as
// covering that hop. The harness's dependence on the placement invariant
// below is tracked in INTR-395.
