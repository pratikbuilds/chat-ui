// Multi-step signed outbound send regression test.
//
// A genuine multi-step (2+ step) workflow deployment must register a
// signing identity for its deployment mail address on the host transport,
// exactly as a single-step deployment does. Every step of a multi-step
// deployment signs its outbound mail as the ONE deployment-wide address
// (`<anchorRunId>@<domain>`), so if that address is not registered a
// step's `env.transport.send` rejects with "not registered", the step
// fails, and the run fails.
//
// This deploys a two-step workflow BY SOURCE-REF whose sending step's agent
// carries the inline `mail_send` tool from the `mail-tool.ts` fixture in its
// transport variant (the mock inference drives the tool call on the first
// request that exposes it). The tool routes through the real outbound chain --
// supervisor-backed transport -> outbound bridge -> `outbound.message` IPC ->
// supervisor `sendOutbound` -> host transport SIGNED send -- so the send
// reaches the host transport as the deployment address. The sidecar forwards
// the delivered `mail.outbound` frame to the hub for persistence, where the
// fixture captures its signing sender. A captured frame whose sender is the
// deployment address is a load-bearing proof that the address held a
// registered signing identity; a registration gap would reject the send inside
// the step and forward no frame.
//
// The sender is a step of a multi-step deployment (not a single-step head),
// so this covers the deployment-scoped registration the single-step path
// already had and the multi-step path lacked.
