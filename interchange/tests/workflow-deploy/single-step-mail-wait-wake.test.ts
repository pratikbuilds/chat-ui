// Single-step warm-agent mail_wait mid-turn wake (INTR-480).
//
// Proves that the supervisor's eager-commit + `mailbox.notify` decouples mail
// VISIBILITY from turn dispatch: a `mail_wait` blocked mid-turn wakes on a
// SECOND inbound mail that arrives while the agent is still inside that turn,
// with no second turn dispatched to carry it.
//
// Shape. The warm agent's mock provider calls `mail_wait` on its first turn,
// querying for a sender (`WAKE_FROM`) that has NOT written yet -- so the
// initial mailbox search finds nothing and the wait registers a watch and
// blocks. The trigger mail (mail 1, from a DIFFERENT sender) opened the run
// but does not satisfy the query. The test confirms the run is parked in
// `mail_wait` (started, no terminal event, the `mail_wait` inference issued),
// then fires mail 2 from `WAKE_FROM`. The supervisor eager-commits mail 2 into
// the per-run mailbox and fires `mailbox.notify`; the child's watch registry
// resolves the blocked `mail_wait` with mail 2's content, the turn completes,
// and the agent's reply echoes the waited message behind `WAITED:`.
//
// Load-bearing assertion: the run TRIGGERED BY MAIL 1 completes with a reply
// carrying MAIL 2's body. That reply could only be produced if `mail_wait`,
// blocked inside the mail-1 turn, received mail 2 through the eager-commit +
// notify path -- the mail-1 turn never dispatched a turn for mail 2. A reply
// carrying a `timeout` error (mail_wait expiring without a match) would fail
// this test, which is exactly the failure mode if eager-commit + notify did
// not wake the wait.
