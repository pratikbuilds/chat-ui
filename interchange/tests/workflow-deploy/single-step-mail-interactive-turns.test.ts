// Single-step warm-agent INTERACTIVE multi-turn conversation (INTR-480).
//
// Proves the interactive conversational mail path for a warm single-step agent
// whose step declares `triggers: "unbounded"`. Unlike the two-turn-thread
// sibling -- which holds the conversation open WITHIN one turn via `mail_wait`
// -- this agent replies to each inbound and RETURNS. The runtime re-arms the
// step on a snapshot-less `input` park after every turn, so the SECOND inbound
// mail is dispatched as turn 2 via `signal.deliver` on the SAME stable run
// (its runId is the deployment address's local part; see `deriveWorkflowRunId`
// -- "a property of the deployment, not of the trigger occurrence"), rather
// than opening a new run or being rejected as terminal.
//
// Run model. A batch step (`triggers` absent / `1`) completes on its first
// output, so a second inbound would hit a terminal run and be refused. With
// `triggers: "unbounded"` the step never self-completes: it re-arms on an input
// park (`run.ts` re-arm), and the supervisor's dispatch loop routes the next
// inbound onto that park as `signal.deliver` (turn 2) instead of `trigger.fire`
// (a fresh run). Turn 2's mail flows through the step-invoker's
// `buildInboundMessageFromMail` -> `seedInbound` connector hook exactly like
// turn 1, so the connector thread continues across the two dispatched turns and
// turn 2's reply threads onto turn-2's mail.
//
// The scripted mock drives that loop deterministically: on each turn it returns
// a plain text reply (no tool call, so the step produces an OUTPUT and the
// runtime re-arms; NO `mail_wait`, so the run does not stay inside one turn).
// Each reply is drained through the warm agent's connector reply path, which
// composes the outbound `In-Reply-To`/`To`/`Cc` from the durable connector
// thread the `seedInbound` hook advanced -- so the delivered wire headers are a
// faithful proof of which mail each turn's reply threaded onto.
//
// Assertions, read off the delivered `mail.outbound` bytes (via `persistMail`'s
// retained `raw`, parsed with `parseHeaderSection`) and the run event log:
//   (a) exactly ONE `RunStarted` for the deployment runId across both turns,
//       consuming mail 1; mail 2 opened no run of its own and the run reached
//       no terminal event between the turns (the unbounded re-arm kept it live).
//   (b) R1's wire In-Reply-To == m1 (To == userA); R2's wire In-Reply-To == m2
//       (To == userB) -- each turn's reply threaded onto that turn's mail. R2
//       also carries the FULL References ancestry [m1, r1, m2] (mail 2's own
//       References plus mail 2's Message-Id), not a truncated [m2]; R1's is the
//       single-element [m1] the opener seeds.
//   (c) mail 2 was consumed as turn 2 on the same run: a `SignalReceived` whose
//       signalId is mail 2's Message-Id, plus two input re-arms serviced.
//   (d) connector cc-accumulation: R2 cc-includes userA, the prior turn's
//       participant carried forward -- the connector thread continued across the
//       two dispatched turns rather than restarting on mail 2.
