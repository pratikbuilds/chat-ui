// Crash-loop guard acceptance-gate integration test.
//
// Proves the INTR-193 acceptance requirement: repeated unexpected child
// exits within the crash-loop window latch the deployment to the terminal
// `crash-looping` state instead of respawning forever, and the latch
// commits a `RunFailed` for the deployment's run.
//
// Shape: deploy a workflow, then SIGKILL the workflow-process child three
// times in quick succession. No mail is fired: the crash-loop guard counts
// child-process exits, not runs, so the deployment's anchor run (born
// `deployed`) is what the latch marks `RunFailed`. The 3rd unexpected exit
// trips the default `crashLoopMaxCount=3` within `crashLoopWindowMs=60s`;
// the supervisor stops respawning and tears down to `crash-looping`.
//
// Landing each kill on a RUNNING child (not one mid-`recycling`-handshake,
// which would fail the respawn to `stopped` instead of counting a crash)
// is sequenced off the supervisor's own stderr markers: a distinct
// per-crash `respawning after <Nms> backoff` line proves each crash was
// counted, and a killed child's replacement is confirmed alive by a fresh,
// stable pid before the next kill. A mistimed kill produces no such marker,
// so the wait never returns and the test's own budget fails it loud rather
// than silently mis-verifying.
//
// SCOPE: the crash driver is a real SIGKILL, not a self-crashing workflow
// body -- the declarative workflow DSL cannot express a body that crashes
// its own process, and a signal is one of the exit kinds the guard targets.
// Two acceptance sub-clauses are covered elsewhere, by design:
//   - The stable-run reset of the crash counter is a supervisor-internal
//     timer, unit-tested deterministically with an injected clock in
//     `packages/workflow-host/src/supervisor/crash-respawn.test.ts`; a 60s
//     wall-clock wait here would be inappropriate.
//   - "Redeploy resets the counter" is a fresh-supervisor tautology (a
//     redeploy mints a new supervisor whose counter is empty), not a guard
//     behavior worth integration complexity.
// The DB status flip (`workflow_run.status -> failed`) is NOT asserted
// here: this harness's hub is a stub that does not run the production
// `markTerminal` pack-receive path, so the observable latch surface is the
// committed `RunFailed` event, read through the real push pipeline.
//
// Harness justification: SPAWN-REAL. Real hub, real sidecar subprocess,
// real workflow-process child, mock inference. The crashes are genuine
// SIGKILLs; the latch rides the production crash-loop guard.
