// Acceptance test: a hub reconnect re-emits a parked run's correlation so the
// run becomes approvable again, and an approver can then resolve the recovered
// correlation to drive the parked run to completion.
//
// The scenario the ticket names is "suspend with the hub down -> hub comes up
// -> the correlation is registered and the run is approvable". The load-bearing
// state is the ABSENCE of the parked run's `signal_correlation` + `approval`
// rows at the hub (the `signal.correlation.register` frame the suspend emitted
// never co-wrote them) followed by their APPEARANCE after the hub link
// reconnects. The recovery is the sidecar's Trigger B: on the reconnect
// route announcement the hub-link fires `onWorkflowAddressesRoutable`, which
// calls `reEmitParkedCorrelations(address)`, which asks the deployment's live
// supervisor to re-query its child's durably-parked approval correlations and
// re-emit each through the suspension sink -> a fresh
// `signal.correlation.register` frame reaches the hub -> the co-write lands the
// rows -> the run is approvable. The test then approves the recovered
// correlation through the real resolve route and asserts the parked run resumes
// to RunCompleted, so the re-emitted registration is proven to be a live route
// the resolver can drive, not merely a row that reappeared.
//
// Making "the register did not co-write" deterministic
// ----------------------------------------------------
// Emitting the register while the hub link is genuinely down would require
// holding the child in inference across a link drop -- a race with no harness
// hook to gate it, and this file must not modify the shared harness. Two
// hub-side facts let the scenario be forced deterministically instead:
//
//   1. On a mere WebSocket drop the sidecar subprocess and the deployment's
//      supervisor stay alive; only the hub link reconnects. The parked run is
//      never resumed, so the child keeps the approval park in durable state and
//      still reports it to a `parked-correlations.request`. So dropping the link
//      does NOT respawn the child: Trigger A (child re-establishment) never
//      fires on this path, and the ONLY re-emit driver on reconnect is Trigger
//      B (`onWorkflowAddressesRoutable`).
//
//   2. The parked run's `signal_correlation` + `approval` rows are hub-side DB
//      state. Deleting them while the link is down reproduces exactly the state
//      a hub that missed the suspend-time register would be in: a child parked
//      on a correlation with no rows at the hub.
//
// So the test fires the trigger with the link up (the run parks and its initial
// register co-writes the rows -- proving the run genuinely parked and the
// co-write is wired), captures the correlationId, drops the link, DELETES both
// rows while disconnected, asserts they are absent, then reconnects and asserts
// they reappear. The reappearance can ONLY come from the reconnect re-emitting
// the still-parked correlation's register: no other actor writes these rows,
// the run is never resumed, and the child is never respawned. A regression that
// removed the Trigger B re-emit would leave the rows deleted and the poll would
// block until this test's own budget ends it.
//
// Harness justification: SPAWN-REAL. A real hub server, a real sidecar
// subprocess, a real workflow-process child, and a test inference provider. The
// suspend/park half runs against the real sidecar through the shared
// `deploy-flow-env` fixture; the co-write + row assertions run against a real
// migrated Postgres schema (`@intx/test-harness`), bridged by wiring the fixture
// hub's `registerSignalCorrelation` lookup to the real DB co-write. The drop is
// a genuine server-side WebSocket close; the recovery is the sidecar's real
// allocation-authenticated `hub-link` reconnect and the supervisor re-emitting
// the parked correlation.
//
// Single-test file. The `deploy-flow-env` (real sidecar subprocess + its
// on-disk warm step-state) is `beforeAll`-scoped, while the DB resets per test.
// A second test would inherit the first run's warm workspace and live parked
// run; a run-once guard below fails loud if a second test is ever added here
// rather than letting that assumption rot.
