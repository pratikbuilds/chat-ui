// role, which owns DDL and can create/drop schemas), and provides the
// per-test schema-name generator. Higher-level harness lifecycle
// helpers build on these.

/**
 * Returns true when the repo has the `.env` files this harness reads:
 * `.env` (connection host/port/database) and `.env.migrate` (the
 * migration role). A suite uses this so a fresh checkout without a
 * configured database can still run `make all`: the DB-dependent tests
 * skip instead of failing.
 *
 * Apply it in one of two shapes. A skip must gate every place that
 * reaches the database, and the two shapes cover the two places a hook
 * can live:
 *
 *   1. Wrap the suite in `describe.skipIf(!harnessDbEnvAvailable())(...)`
 *      and keep the DB-touching `beforeAll`/`beforeEach` inside that
 *      `describe`. `skipIf` skips the hooks together with the bodies.
 *
 *   2. For a setup hook at file scope (column 0, outside any
 *      `describe`), open the hook with
 *      `if (!harnessDbEnvAvailable()) return;`. A file-scope `beforeAll`
 *      runs even when `describe.skipIf` skips the bodies, so the
 *      `describe` guard alone does not cover it; the early return does.
 *
 * Absence-only: a file that exists but lacks a required key still
 * surfaces a loud error from `loadHarnessDbConfig`. The gate is
 * specifically for the "no database env at all" case.

 * The distinction matters in a fresh worktree, where the env files are absent
 * because they are gitignored: gating on the narrower predicate lets a suite
 * run and then fail on a missing key, which is the loud-error case this gate
