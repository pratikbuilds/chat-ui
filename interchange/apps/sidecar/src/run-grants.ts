// Per-run grants read primitives shared by the two sidecar modules that
// resolve a run's authorization from disk: the supervisor wiring
// (`workflow-host-wiring.ts`), which reads a run's grants at the
// `onRunStart` barrier, and the in-process child runtime
// (`workflow-substrate-factory.ts`), which reads the PARENT run's grants
// to bind a spawned child's authorize. Both destinations read the same
// `runs/<runId>/grants.json` file in a deployment's `workflow-run` repo,
// so the read lives in one place.
//
// The module's dependency surface is deliberately narrow -- node fs/path,
// arktype, and the substrate `RepoStore` type -- so importing it into the
// child subprocess module does not drag the hub-agent deploy-router
// surface `workflow-host-wiring.ts` also depends on into the child
// binary.
