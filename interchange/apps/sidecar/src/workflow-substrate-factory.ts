// the host-process scheduler singleton (adapted to the runtime's
// `Scheduler` shape), and the sidecar's grant-rule evaluator.
//
// The factory consumes the workflow-host's typed `SubstrateFactoryEnv`
// -- the parsed `SpawnTimeEnv` plus a narrow `substrateConfig`
// record carrying only the keys the binary listed in
// `RunWorkflowChildFromProcessEnvOpts.substrateConfigKeys`. The
// factory does not read `process.env` itself; the binary owns the
// only crossing of that boundary.

// Single-writer architecture: the workflow-run repo's ref has exactly
// one writer at a time -- the supervisor. The child opens a bare
// `createAgentRepoStore` against the shared on-disk data dir for
// read-only operations (`getRepoDir`, `subscribe`, `resolveRef`,
// etc.) and exposes a proxy `RepoStore` whose
// `writeTreePreservingPrefix` forwards every write over the control
// IPC into the supervisor's substrate. The supervisor's substrate is
// wrapped with the boot-edge pack-push facade, so the hub push fires
// as part of the supervisor's normal write path -- the child does
// not open its own pack-push pipeline.
