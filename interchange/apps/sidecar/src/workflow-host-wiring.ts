 *   - Every `stepOrder` entry matches `STEP_ID_PATTERN` so per-step

 *     boundary.
 *   - Every `stepOrder` entry has a corresponding `steps[id]` entry.

 *   - Every `stepOrder` entry has a corresponding `sources[id]`
 *     entry, and that entry is a non-empty array (the step's ordered
 *     failover chain). The arktype narrow already enforces both; the
 *     re-check here surfaces a structured router-side error instead of
 *     an arktype validation failure at the wire boundary, which keeps
 *     the failure shape consistent with the rest of the validations
 *     this function owns. An empty chain would leave the reactor with
 *     no initial source, so it is rejected here rather than deferred to

  //     would re-enter that teardown. The supervisor has already terminated, so
  //     there is nothing to shut down.
  //   - It does NOT delete the durable run record or on-disk state (unlike the
  //     `undeploy` hook). The run record mirrors the hub's deployment intent,
  //     and a self-termination is not a hub-initiated undeploy: the hub still
  //     believes the address is deployed. Leaving the record lets a boot restore
  //     re-spawn a fresh supervisor for the address, and a same-process redeploy
  //     overwrites the record destructively. This preserves the pre-existing
  //     boot-restore behavior exactly -- a self-terminated deployment already
  //     left its record on disk before this reclaim existed; the reclaim only
  //     drops in-memory routing state, never durable state.
  //   - It does NOT call `unregisterDeployment`, so the deployment address
  //     mapping (`deploymentAddressRegistry`) is RETAINED. That mapping is
  //     consulted only by the OUTBOUND workflow-run pack push
  //     (`registry.resolve`), which the supervisor itself drives; no inbound
  //     frame consults it (a frame racing the reclaim is rejected by the
  //     routers above, not routed through this mapping). The supervisor's own
  //     terminal `RunFailed` commit -- the crash-loop latch writes it AFTER its
  //     teardown fires this sink -- resolves this mapping, so dropping it here
  //     would strand that commit ("no run address registered for deployment")
  //     and leave the crash-loop with no durable failure tombstone. Retaining a
  //     stale entry never blocks a redeploy: `record` overwrites idempotently,
  //     and an operator `undeploy` or a process restart clears it.
