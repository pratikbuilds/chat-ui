// Durable conversation state for the warm single-step agent (design §3c,
// §4 Phase D1).
//
// A long-lived single-step agent holds its multi-turn conversation in
// the reactor's in-memory turn buffer, backed by a per-step isogit
// `ContextStore`. That store is rooted per run/attempt, so it is lost
// the moment the warm agent's child is killed and respawned: the
// rebuilt agent loads a fresh, empty per-run store and the conversation
// continuity is gone.
//
// This module makes the warm agent's conversation DURABLE in the
// workflow-run substrate (the single-writer proxy `RepoStore`, written
// through the supervisor). The durable copy lives under the workflow-run
// repo at a stable per-agent path (`agent-state/<agentKey>/...`), sibling
// to the per-run event log under `runs/<runId>/...` and NOT confused with
// it. On a new run (and after a child respawn, once the warm agent is
// rebuilt lazily) the conversation is restored from the substrate into
// the agent's local store BEFORE the agent's reactor loads, so multi-turn
// continuity holds across runs and across respawn.
//
// Two-tier on-disk layout (design §4, Phase D1). The prior design wrote
// the WHOLE conversation as a single `conversation.json` blob on every
// message. That re-serialized and re-hashed every prior turn per message,
// so the per-message durable cost grew O(N) in the turn count -- O(N^2)
// over a conversation. D1 replaces it with an append-only, bucket-sharded
// write-ahead log plus a periodic compacted checkpoint:
//
//   agent-state/<agentKey>/
//     checkpoint.json        compacted full snapshot (turns + metadata)
//     checkpoint.meta.json   { checkpointSeq: <boundary>, turnCount,
//                              tokenUsage, pendingOperations,
//                              connectorState }
//     wal/<bucket>/<seq>.json  one per-boundary delta blob keyed by mirror
//                              BOUNDARY seq, carrying that boundary's
//                              0-or-more new turns plus the freshest metadata
//
// The WAL is keyed by mirror BOUNDARY, not by turn: each `mirrorToSubstrate`
// writes exactly one entry, even when the boundary added no new turns. That
// makes metadata (pendingOperations, tokenUsage, connectorState) persist on
// EVERY boundary -- a turnless-but-metadata-mutating boundary still commits
// a zero-turn entry, so restore never reconstructs stale metadata. (Keying
// the entry by turn dropped metadata on turnless boundaries, which regressed
// the byte-for-byte metadata-equivalence invariant; per-boundary keying is
// the fix.)
//
// `bucket = floor(boundarySeq / WAL_BUCKET_SIZE)` (B = 128) bounds any
// single directory's tree-object size so no commit re-hashes a tree that
// grows with N (a flat `wal/<seq>.json` directory would itself be O(N) per
// commit). Compaction every CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL boundaries (K = 64, i.e.
// once the live WAL reaches K entries) folds the WAL into a fresh
// `checkpoint.json` (capturing the freshest metadata in checkpoint.meta) and
// truncates the WAL, so between checkpoints the WAL holds at most K entries
// and per-boundary durable cost is ~O(1) amortized. K and B are constants
// here; the design flags them as measurement-tunable.
//
// Restore = load `checkpoint.json` (folded turns + its metadata) then replay
// the WAL tail in boundary-seq order, concatenating each boundary's turns
// and taking the LATEST entry's metadata (the last WAL entry wins; the
// checkpoint's metadata is the base when the WAL is empty). This is pure
// state reconstruction from recorded outputs -- never re-inference. It
// rebuilds the EXACT turn list + metadata the old whole-blob mirror would
// have restored.
//
// Substrate-merge constraint (load-bearing, design §4 "Substrate-merge
// note"). `writeTreePreservingPrefix`'s `merge` callback receives only
// the DIRECT CHILDREN of `preservePrefix`, and the substrate's
// `clearPrefix` step recursively removes the whole `preservePrefix`
// subtree before writing the merge's returned set (paths outside the
// prefix pass through untouched). A WAL blob is two levels below
// `agent-state/<key>/`, so:
//
//   - WAL append uses `preservePrefix = agent-state/<key>/wal/<bucket>/`.
//     The bucket's existing blobs ARE direct children, so the merge
//     pre-image is exactly that bucket and the append adds one entry --
//     no isogit side-read, and the checkpoint / other buckets are
//     untouched (outside the prefix).
//   - Checkpoint write + WAL truncate uses `preservePrefix =
//     agent-state/<key>/`. The top-level checkpoint files are direct
//     children; the merge returns ONLY those files and NO `wal/...`
//     paths, so the recursive `clearPrefix` at `agent-state/<key>/` drops
//     the entire WAL subtree in the same atomic commit. The truncate
//     needs no nested read: omitting the WAL paths from the returned set
//     IS the truncate.
//
// Persistence sink (the riskiest part, design §6). The connector router's
// `snapshot()` / `restore()` surface and the harness's
// `createWrappedStorageOverrides` are reused, but the persistence sink is
// repointed from the agent's local isogit store to the workflow-run
// substrate. Both the WAL append and the checkpoint write route through
// the proxy `writeTreePreservingPrefix`; because the supervisor is the
// single writer and serializes every write to the workflow-run ref under
// a per-repo lock, and the `agent-state/<key>/...` prefix is disjoint from
// the run-event prefix (`runs/<runId>/events/`), the conversation write
// never races nor clobbers the run-event log -- both pass through the same
// single writer, and the preserve-prefix merge leaves every other subtree
// byte-for-byte intact.
//
// Timing (design §4 Phase D1, invariant 1). This is a STRUCTURE-only
// change. The mirror is still `await`ed synchronously at the same run
// boundary (`onRunBoundary` -> `mirrorToSubstrate`), so every turn is
// still durably committed before the next message is processed. D1
// changes WHAT the write does (O(1) append instead of O(N) whole-blob),
// not WHEN it happens. The run log is NOT yet a durable backstop for the
// turn (it carries a constant ref, design rev-2 FACT 1), so the
// conversation copy here remains the sole durable copy of the agent's
// per-turn output -- which is exactly why D1 keeps the write synchronous.
// The async flusher, run-log enrichment, and crash reconciliation are
// later, conditional phases (D2-D4), not done here.
//
// Commit granularity (greybeard's pick, design §3c open question). The
// design calls for connector-state-change-driven commits via the router's
// `onStateChanged` hook. The warm-agent path drives the connector router
// through `seedInbound`: each mail-derived inbound message routes and
// commits its thread state before the agent's send, so `onStateChanged`
// fires and enqueues a change-driven mirror. The run-boundary mirror (per
// message) still runs unconditionally, so the two triggers are
// complementary -- the seed persists the connector state promptly, the
// boundary persists the turn delta.
//
// Defensive: a restore that finds a checkpoint or WAL but cannot
// parse/replay it THROWS (a lost or corrupt conversation on respawn is a
// correctness failure, not a silently-fresh start). A mirror write failure
// surfaces so a dropped durability write is visible rather than leaving
// the next respawn to read a stale snapshot.
