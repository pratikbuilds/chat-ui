 * Replace `path` with `contents` atomically and durably. The bytes land

 * `path`; because rename is atomic within a directory, a reader only
 * ever observes the prior complete file or the new complete file, never
 * a torn one. The fsync before the rename is what extends that
 * guarantee past process death to OS crash / power loss: without it, the
 * ext4 delayed-allocation window can surface the renamed path as a
 * zero-length file after a power loss.
 *
 * The parent directory is fsynced after the rename so the new link is
 * itself durable, but a filesystem that rejects directory fsync
 * (FAT/exFAT, some network mounts) only degrades durability -- the file
 * is already renamed and fsynced -- so that failure is logged, not
 * thrown.
 *
 * `mode` is applied on the temp file's creation, so it takes effect on
 * every write. A plain in-place overwrite of an existing file would
 * silently keep the original file's mode instead.
 *
 * The temp file follows `createTarballCache`'s `.tmp.<pid>.<rand>`
 * naming convention for consistency across the sidecar's staged writes.
