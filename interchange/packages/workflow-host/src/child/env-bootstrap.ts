// Spawn-time env parser for the workflow-process child.
//
// The supervisor's spawn path constructs a fresh env object carrying
// only the IPC trust anchors plus a tightly-scoped set of deployment
// identifiers. The binary parses `process.env` once at start and hands
// the validated struct to `runWorkflowChild`. The struct shape is the
// only env-shaped surface the runtime body sees; everything else flows
// through IPC frames.
//
// The IPC trust anchors carried here are public-half values: the
// supervisor's Ed25519 PUBLIC key (`HOST_PUBKEY`) plus the shared HMAC
// key (`IPC_HMAC_KEY`) the supervisor minted at spawn time. The
// supervisor's Ed25519 PRIVATE key never appears in env per the IPC
// threat model; the child verifies but never signs control frames.
