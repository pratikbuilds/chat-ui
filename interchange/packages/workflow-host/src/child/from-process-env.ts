// Process-shaped convenience wrapper around `runWorkflowChild`.
//
// The wrapper crosses the only boundary that touches `process.env`,
// `process.stdin`/`process.stdout`, and the inherited event-channel
// file descriptor. Each host ships a ~5-line entry script
// (`#!/usr/bin/env bun` + an `import` + an `await` of this function)
// against a substrate-factory of its own; the factory consumes a
// narrow typed env struct rather than `NodeJS.ProcessEnv`, and the
// runtime body never sees the process boundary.
//
// The factory's typed env carries the spawn-time keys the supervisor
// promises plus the substrate-config keys the host injected on top.
// The supervisor's `WorkflowSupervisorBindings.substrateEnv` is the
// only documented surface for the substrate-config slot; the host
// places its own data-dir / signing-key / definition-repo keys there
// at supervisor-construction time and reads them back here.
