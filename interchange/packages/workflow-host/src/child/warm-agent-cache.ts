// Warm-agent cache for the workflow-process child (design §3b).
//
// A long-lived single-step agent is built once -- tools materialized,
// plugins instantiated, the LSP subprocess spawned -- and reused across
// every inbound message. Re-materializing tools and re-spawning the LSP
// per message is the instantiate-send-teardown cost the warm cache
// removes; keeping the agent alive across messages is also what
// preserves in-memory conversation continuity (durability across child
// respawns lands in §3c, a later sub-step).
//
// Ownership and lifetime. The cache lives in the child's address space,
// owned by the run-loop (`run-child.ts`), NOT the supervisor. The
// step-invoker consults it on every step invocation: a cache hit reuses
// the warm agent, a miss builds and stores one lazily. The cached agent
// is torn down -- the wrapped `agent.close()` runs, disposing plugins
// and killing the LSP subprocess -- only at the run-loop's eviction
// points (child shutdown, deployment undeploy, recycle, post-drain
// teardown), never between messages. On recycle the child process dies,
// killing the LSP grandchild regardless; the respawned child starts with
// an empty cache and re-warms lazily.
//
// Per-message event sink. The agent's `stream()` is consumed once, for
// the agent's whole life, by a single forwarder owned by the entry. The
// per-step `onEvent` sink the runtime threads in differs per message
// (it carries the run id in its error-log path), so the forwarder routes
// through a mutable reference the step-invoker rewrites before each
// `agent.send`. The forwarder loop ends only when the agent closes at an
// eviction point.
//
// Warm-keep is gated explicitly: the cache is constructed only when the
// deploy projection marks the deployment a warm candidate (the
// single-step launched agent). Multi-step deployments pass no cache and
// keep instantiate-send-teardown per step. The decision is never a
// silent default -- a multi-step agent is never warm-kept.
