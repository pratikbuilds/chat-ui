// Capture LogTape records for one test file, so a test can await a log line
// instead of polling for it.
//
// Some decisions announce themselves only in the log. A guard that returns
// without touching any observable state leaves the record as the sole
// evidence it ran, and a test that wants to assert on such a decision has no
// other signal to await. Waiting on the record is what "Synchronizing on
// State, Not Time" in CONVENTIONS.md asks for, and it replaces a poll whose
// deadline had to be guessed against whatever the code under test was
// waiting on.
//
// The capture is per-call, not module-level. The unit pass gives a worker one
// module registry for every file it runs, so a module-level record array
// would accumulate another file's records and a module-level waiter list
// would let another file's log line resolve this file's wait.
// `createChangeNotifier` and `createSupervisorReaper` are factories for the
// same reason.
//
// `configureSync` is process-global, so `install` saves the configuration it
// replaces and `restore` puts it back. Wire the three lifecycle methods to
// `beforeAll`, `afterAll`, and `beforeEach`.

   *
   * `needle` must identify the record uniquely within its own test. Matching
   * on a message some other test also emits is what makes this a barrier in
   * name only: `reset` clears the records a previous test logged, but it
   * cannot exclude the ones still arriving from work that test left running,
   * and nothing in a record says which test caused it. A wait satisfied by
   * such a straggler returns before the awaited work has happened, and the
   * assertion behind it reads pre-barrier state and passes. Where two tests
   * exercise the same path, vary an input the record carries -- see the
   * crash-reason token in `substrate-write.test.ts`.
   *
   * A test that triggers fire-and-forget work owes the next test the same
   * courtesy: await that work's own completion record before returning, so
   * it cannot straggle across the boundary in the first place.
