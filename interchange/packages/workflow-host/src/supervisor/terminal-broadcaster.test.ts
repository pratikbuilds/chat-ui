// Unit coverage for the per-cohort terminal-run broadcaster.
//
// The recycle suite pins iterator finalisation on cohort teardown
// but does NOT pin the actual race where a terminal event from the
// old cohort arrives during the new cohort's spawn. The supervisor
// wires one broadcaster per spawn cohort and the previous cohort's
// broadcaster is disposed when the new cohort takes over. The tests
// below
// exercise the broadcaster's notify/dispose surface directly so the
// cross-cohort isolation is observable without standing up the full
// supervisor.
