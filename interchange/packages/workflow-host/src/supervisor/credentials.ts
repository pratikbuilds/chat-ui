// Per-step `credentialsSnapshot` assembly.
//
// At spawn time, the supervisor reads each workflow step's grants out
// of its `agent-state` repo and forwards the resulting per-step
// snapshot to the workflow-process over the control IPC. The snapshot
// never lands on disk in the child's view and is never placed in
// spawn-time env -- the env carries only the IPC trust anchors. The
// child receives credentials over the authenticated control channel
// once both halves are connected.
//
// Each step's snapshot is pinned to a content hash so the child can
// detect a stale snapshot (e.g. one that arrived after a `grants-
// updated` push the child already processed). The hash is the
// sha256 of the canonicalized JSON serialization of the snapshot's
// per-step `grants` array -- not the git tree SHA of the underlying
// `agent-state` repo's `grants` ref. The substrate's tree SHA is
// implementation-coupled to the path of the file inside the repo;
// hashing the canonical JSON gives a stable identifier the child can
// compare across pushes without taking a dependency on the
// substrate's git layout.
//
// Per-step address derivation (Q6.4 discovery decision):
//   - Multi-step deployments use `<runId>-<stepId>@<domain>`.
//   - Trivial (single-step) deployments use the deployment's own
//     mail address as the sole step's address.
// The derivation is supplied by the caller as a `deriveStepAddress`
// callback so the supervisor doesn't have to encode the deployment-
// domain into the workflow-host package.
