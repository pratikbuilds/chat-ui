// D2 per-leg substrate-attribution instrumentation (measurement-only).
//
// This module is the off-by-default observability + A/B surface the D2
// latency re-attribution drives. NONE of it runs in production: the
// supervisor only reaches these helpers when a `onDispatchTiming`
// observer is wired (the same env-gated seam the 4.7 latency gate added)
// and only consults the repack toggle when the boot edge supplies a
// non-zero repack interval. With the observer unwired and the toggle
// absent, the supervisor samples no clock, reads no directory, and forks
// no `git gc` -- the dispatch path is byte-for-byte unchanged.
//
// The counters are deliberately filesystem-level reads against the
// workflow-run repo's on-disk working tree (resolved via
// `RepoStore.getRepoDir`, a pure path computation), NOT reaches into
// isogit internals. That keeps the attribution honest about what it can
// observe cheaply and avoids coupling the measurement to the storage
// layer's private object model. `runs/` and `addresses/<addr>/consumed/`
// fan-out is exactly the never-pruned tree growth the design (§9)
// implicates; loose-object count + `.git` byte size are the pack-growth
// proxies the §10c repack A/B discriminates against.
