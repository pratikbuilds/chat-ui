// Workflow-run-substrate backing for the `@intx/mailbox` `MailboxStore`.
//
// The `MailboxStore` mutation surface is SYNCHRONOUS, but the workflow-run
// substrate is an async git store. This backing follows the shape of an IMAP
// client with a local cache: the async `createSubstrateMailboxStore` factory
// loads the committed `mailbox/INBOX/` METADATA (`index.json`) into an
// in-memory mirror on open, exposes the synchronous mutation surface over that
// mirror, and persists the current state back to the substrate through
// `flush`. Callers mutate synchronously (append / addFlags / removeFlags /
// remove) and `await flush()` at a boundary.
//
// The per-message raw RFC 2822 bytes are NOT loaded on open and are NOT held
// resident: `readRaw(uid)` reads a message's `<uid>.eml` blob on demand from
// the committed-read snapshot the open pinned. The only raw this backing keeps
// in memory is that of a message appended-but-not-yet-flushed; a successful
// `flush` drops it. So the resident footprint of a long-lived warm mailbox is
// bounded to metadata regardless of how much mail it has accumulated.
//
// On-disk layout, a top-level subtree of the workflow-run repo (one mailbox per
// deployment repo):
//
//   mailbox/INBOX/index.json      committed metadata: uidValidity, the
//                                 uid/modseq counters, one entry per live
//                                 message (uid, modseq, flags, pre-parsed
//                                 envelope), and the expunged-uid tombstones
//                                 QRESYNC answers `vanished` from.
//   mailbox/INBOX/<uid>.eml       the verbatim raw RFC 2822 bytes of each live
//                                 message, so `fetchFull` verifies signatures
//                                 byte-exactly. Write-once per uid.
//
// Reads resolve from the committed substrate (`openCommittedReads`), never the
// lagging working tree, matching the sibling `mail-part-store` reader. Writes
// go through `writeTreeDelta`: `index.json` changes on every mutation and is
// always put; each `<uid>.eml` is immutable, so a flush puts only the blobs
// appended since the last successful flush and deletes only those whose
// message was removed since then, and the substrate carries every untouched
// `.eml` forward by object id. This keeps a flush O(delta) rather than
// O(mailbox), so a long-lived warm conversational mailbox does not re-hash its
// whole history on each append or flag change. The committed subtree the delta
// leaves behind is byte-identical in shape to a full rewrite of the same live
// set. The kind handler's push-time validation of this subtree is owned
// separately by the hub replication layer; this module owns the on-disk shape
// it validates.
