// Workflow-deploy derivation and source-pinning utilities.
//
// The deployment address model is a pure function of `(runId, stepId,
// domain)`: a one-step workflow has no distinct step address -- the lone
// step IS the deployment head (`deriveRunAddress`) -- while a workflow with
// more than one step derives per-step addresses of the form
// `<runId>-<stepId>@<domain>`. Because the derivation is pure, the
// supervisor reconstructs the same addresses at spawn time without any
// per-deploy state, and `resolveStepAddress` is the single owner of the
// head/step collapse decision for a consumer that must choose an address
// from the host-sourced step count alone.
//
// The source-pinning utilities (`pickStepInferenceSource`,
// `buildInertProjectionStepSources`, `buildInertBodyStepSources`,
// `isSourceApproved`) resolve each step's inference source. An agent-bearing
// step resolves against the operator-approved grant set, so an unapproved
// source fails the deploy closed rather than slipping past the capability-walk
// gate. A step that cannot invoke inference takes the deploy's default source
// as an inert placeholder: the wire shape requires a source for every step,
// but that step never issues a request through it.
