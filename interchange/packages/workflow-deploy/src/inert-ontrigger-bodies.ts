// Enumerate the inline trigger bodies of a FROZEN inert projection -- both
// onTrigger section bodies and childWorkflow child definitions, transitively.
//
// On the source-ref (code-sourced) deploy the hub never holds a live
// `WorkflowDefinition` -- it has only the inert `WorkflowProjectionDefinition`
// the gate froze and hashed. This module walks that frozen projection and lifts
// each inline body so the hub can stage it and pin its per-step inference
// sources. Enumeration itself is purely structural: the deploy pin reads each
// body step's declared `(provider, model)` preference through
// `readInertStepInference` when it resolves sources.
//
// The walk mirrors the runtime's per-rung rewrite exactly, so the ref each body
// is staged under equals the ref the runtime reads it back by:
//   - childWorkflow bodies are lifted at EVERY rung (the runtime re-runs
//     `rewriteInlineChildWorkflowBodies` per child run), so the enumeration
//     recurses into every lifted body;
//   - onTrigger bodies are lifted only at the TOP level (the runtime lifts them
//     once at child boot, never inside a spawned body), so an onTrigger section
//     nested inside a spawned body would reach the runtime inline and hard-fail
//     -- this module rejects it at deploy rather than staging an asset the
//     runtime will never read;
//   - a loop body is NOT lifted as an asset -- it runs in-process sharing the
//     parent env, so it needs no sources.json of its own -- but the enumeration
//     recurses INTO it to lift any childWorkflow grandchild, keyed under
//     `inlineBodyRef(loopBodyRef, childStepId)` to match the runtime's rewrite
//     of the loop body copy.
//
// It reads NOTHING off an unvalidated `unknown`: the wire projection types its
// `steps` as pass-through `unknown`, so every field this module reaches is first
// validated through an arktype. A step that claims to be an agent-bearing
// primitive (`step`/`map`) but carries no well-formed `agent.modelSources` is a
// malformed projection and throws, rather than silently pinning a fallback.
//
// Reading a nested body off an inert step is also the one part of the canonical
// step walk the inert representation has to supply itself, so it lives here as
// `inertNestedBodies` -- the counterpart of the live `nestedWorkflowBodies`.
// It owns the descent for the consumers that walk a whole frozen projection,
// so the malformed-container throws below apply on those paths.
// `enumerateInertBodiesAtDepth` in this same module is NOT one of them: it
// hand-rolls a depth-limited descent with its own probes, so a malformed
// container reads as a leaf there rather than throwing. Nothing reaches it
// with an unvalidated step today -- the wire narrow validates every top-level
// step, descent validates each nested body, and the probe gate's totality walk
// runs first -- so the divergence is latent, not exploitable. Whoever adds the
// next container kind has to add it in both places.
//
// Both readers are EXHAUSTIVE OVER THE SAME KIND SET, and that is what the
// reader's shape here buys. The live reader switches over the typed `Primitive`
// union and ends in a `never` assignment; an inert step is `unknown` on the
// wire, so no switch over it can be typed that way. Exhaustiveness over a kind
// set is a property of a TABLE'S KEYS though, independent of how its values are
// typed -- so this reader is a `Record<Primitive["kind"], ...>` whose arms still
// take `unknown` and still probe with arktype. Keying it on the same union the
// live `never` guards makes the two readers fail together: a body-bearing
// primitive added to the live reader and forgotten here is a compile error
// rather than a container the deploy-time totality check reads as a leaf.
