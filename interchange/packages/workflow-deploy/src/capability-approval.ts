// Operator-approval gating for the deploy-time capability walk.
//
// The deploy flow hands the walk's `CapabilityWalkResult` to a gate; the
// gate compares the walk-derived per-step grants against an operator-
// supplied `ApprovalSet` and decides whether the deploy may proceed.
//
// Approval semantics (v1):
//   - The operator supplies one approved surface (`ApprovalSet`) holding the
//     grant-shape strings and the grant requirements they approved. Every
//     grant the walk surfaced on every step must appear in that surface's
//     `grants`; any miss is a per-step `pending` entry and fails the gate.
//   - A non-empty `unresolvedDirectors` field on the walk result is
//     itself a deploy-time failure; the gate surfaces it through
//     `ApprovalDecision` and the caller aborts the deploy.

 * membership test that can actually answer for it:
 *
 *   - `grants` -- the grant-shape strings the capability walk surfaces.
 *     Answered by `Set.has`.
 *   - `requirements` -- the grant requirements a definition declares. A
 *     record has no useful identity, so membership is a structural
 *     comparison over the list (`isApprovedGrantRequirement`).
 *
 * This is ONE approved surface behind ONE operator decision and ONE gate.
 * The split is in the payload, not in the number of approvals: a caller
 * supplies both fields together and the gate consults both.
 *
 * Order does not matter in either field; membership is the only thing the
