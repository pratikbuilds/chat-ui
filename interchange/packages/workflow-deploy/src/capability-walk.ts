// Deploy-time capability walk.
//
// `walkCapabilities(workflow, registry)` is the structural lift of
// `getRequiredEnvKeys` from `@intx/agent`: the env-validation helper
// walks each step's `AgentDefinition` to collect the env-key surface
// the agent declares at instantiation; this walk traverses the same
// shape and emits the grant-shape strings the deploy-time operator-
// approval gate consumes.
//
// The two walks must stay structurally aligned -- a step whose
// `AgentDefinition` would pass `validateEnv` at runtime must produce
// the matching grant set here. The parity test in
// `capability-walk.test.ts` is the load-bearing structural-identity
// check for that claim.
//
// Grant shapes (v1):
//   - `tool:<def.name>`              -- every tool name a factory
//                                        declares via `definitions[i].name`
//                                        (per definition, NOT per factory
//                                        id, so the grant matches the
//                                        runtime `tool:<call.name>` the
//                                        gate authorizes against)
//   - `director:<ref.id>`            -- resolved director ref
//   - `capability:<name>`            -- `AgentDefinition.capabilities`
//   - `inference.source:<id>`        -- `inference.sources[i].provider`
//                                        with `<provider>:<model>`-style
//                                        id (matches the existing
//                                        InferencePreference shape)
//   - `mail.address:<address>`       -- every workflow trigger of type
//                                        `"mail"` (the deployment's
//                                        right to register and receive)
//   - `mail.send:<domain>`           -- the trigger address's domain
//                                        (the deployment's right to
//                                        send mail as that domain)
//
// Wildcard semantics (e.g. `tool:@vendor/foo/*`) are intentionally
// deferred: v1 ships explicit per-tool approvals so the operator UX
// matches what `getRequiredEnvKeys` enforces today. When a deployment
// accumulates enough tool factories that explicit approval is
// unergonomic, the wildcard shape lands as an additive refinement.
//
// Director resolution: the walk calls `effectiveDirectorRef` so the
// absent-director normalization stays identical between this walk and
// `getRequiredEnvKeys`. Director factories loaded from pinned tool
// packages via `interchange.directors` are folded into the registry by
// the caller; this module does not synthesize that registry itself
// because the loader is the layer that owns package materialization.
// An unresolvable director surfaces on `unresolvedDirectors` rather
// than raising -- the deploy flow translates that into a deploy-time
// `"unresolvable director"` failure when it wires this output into
// approval flow.
