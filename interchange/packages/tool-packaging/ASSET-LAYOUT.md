# Tool-package asset layout

Tool packages distributed through the asset substrate live in a
`package-registry` asset. The asset row sits on a tenant; the asset's
backing git repo holds one tarball per name+version under `tarballs/`.

```
<asset-root>/
└── tarballs/
    ├── @intx-tools-mail-0.1.2.tgz
    ├── @intx-tools-posix-0.1.2.tgz
    └── @intx-tools-lsp-0.1.2.tgz
```

Filenames for scoped packages flatten the scope with a `-` separator
(`@scope/tail` → `@scope-tail`) so two scoped packages whose tails
collide remain distinguishable on disk.

## Asset shape

- **Asset kind**: `package-registry`.
- **Asset name**: lowercase-kebab, addressable by REST and resolvable
  via the tenant-inheritance walker. Operators choose the name; the
  workspace's built-ins ship under `workspace-builtins`.
- **Contents**: `tarballs/<basename>-<version>.tgz` files at the root
  of the `tarballs/` directory. Filenames must match the
  `<basename>-<version>.tgz` pattern the `package-registry` kind
  handler validates at push time. Each tarball's `package.json` is
  parsed and validated by the kind handler against the workspace's
  `PackageJSON` schema before the push is accepted.
- **Mount path on the sidecar**: `package-registries/<asset.name>/`,
  resolved by the `package-registry` kind handler. Asset packs land at
  `<workspaceRoot>/<mountPath>/`, so the sidecar's loader finds the
  tarballs at `<workspaceRoot>/package-registries/<asset.name>/tarballs/`.

## Where the manifest lives

The pinned closure is the hub's responsibility: the closure resolver
walks every agent-pinned tool package, resolves transitive dependencies,
and writes a `ToolPackageManifest` (validated by
`@intx/types/tool-packages`) into the deploy pack at
`deploy/tool-packages-manifest.json`. The sidecar reads it from there
at apply time.

Manifest entries whose `source.kind` is `"asset"` carry the asset's id
plus a `package` envelope. The envelope's `format` discriminates where
the bytes live inside the asset: `"tarball"` (this document) points at a
prepackaged `.tgz` blob and carries its `path` and `integrity`;
`"source"` points at a git subtree checked out in place (used by
source-format workflow definitions, see the tool-packaging README). A
tarball entry looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "@intx/tools-mail",
  "version": "0.1.2",
  "source": {
    "kind": "asset",
    "assetId": "ast_workspace_builtins",
    "package": {
      "format": "tarball",
      "path": "tarballs/@intx-tools-mail-0.1.2.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-..."
    }
  }
}
```

The loader joins `source.package.path` against the materialized asset
root on the sidecar to locate the bytes.

## Mount table in the deploy pack

The hub-side session service writes a sidecar-readable mapping from
asset id to mount path into the deploy pack at
`deploy/asset-mounts.json`:

```json
{
  "assetMounts": {
    "ast_workspace_builtins": "package-registries/workspace-builtins/"
  }
}
```

The sidecar's `readDeployTree` parses this file into a
`Map<assetId, mountPath>` and hands it to the loader. The loader uses
the map to resolve every `kind: "asset"` entry — looking up the mount
path by `source.assetId`, then joining it with `source.package.path`
against the workspace's asset root.

## Per-instance apply state on the sidecar

Each apply materializes its resolved closure into a stable, per-deploy-id
directory under the agent's tool-package instance directory
(`<storeDir>/tool-packages/`). The directory is never renamed:

```
<storeDir>/tool-packages/
├── active-deploy-id           # commit switch; content "v1:<deploy-id>"
├── active-deploy-id.dirty     # present only after a degraded persist
└── packages/
    ├── <deploy-id-current>/   # store/<name>/<version>/... for the live deploy
    └── <deploy-id-previous>/  # the immediately-prior deploy, retained
```

The loader builds `packages/<deploy-id>/store/<name>/<version>/` and
dynamic-imports each pinned package's `interchange.tools` entry from that
path. Because the path is never renamed, a package that resolves files
relative to its own on-disk location at run time — `import.meta.url`,
`require.resolve()`, a call-time `await import("./sibling.js")` — keeps
resolving for the life of the deploy.

**Commit.** Staging a deploy directory does not make it live. The commit
is a single write of the `active-deploy-id` file naming the new deploy
id. Until that write lands, the instance is still running the previous
deploy, whose directory is untouched. There is no filesystem rename in
the apply path; the `active-deploy-id` write is the only atomic switch.

**Retention.** A prelude sweep at the start of every apply removes every
`packages/<id>/` except the current deploy and the immediately-prior
one, bounding disk to ~2 closures. The prior deploy is retained as a
liveness window: a session still draining against it may perform a
call-time import into its tree. The next apply reaps it once the prior
session's harness has been torn down.

**Crash safety.** Boot never reads a deploy directory — the harness
rebuilds from the current manifest into a fresh deploy id — so a
half-written deploy directory left by a crash is self-healing: the next
boot re-materializes and the prelude sweep reclaims the orphan. Only
`active-deploy-id` needs durability; it carries an fsync + dirty-marker
ladder owned by the sidecar's materialization layer. See
`packages/tool-packaging/src/atomic-apply.ts` for the full protocol.

## Tarballs

- Bytes are exactly what an npm registry would serve: the package tree
  rooted under `package/`, gzipped tar.
- Integrity is verified by the sidecar loader against the entry's
  `source.package.integrity` field before extraction. The asset substrate's git-commit
  signature provides the trust root; the SRI hash provides byte-level
  integrity at materialization time.
- The workspace's bundled tarballs (`bin/build-builtins.ts`) emit a
  packed `package.json` with `dependencies`, `devDependencies`,
  `optionalDependencies`, and `exports` deleted: every workspace and
  catalog dependency is inlined into a single bundled entry, and the
  tarball carries no `exports` so it cannot be loaded by anything
  other than the tool-package loader. A consumer attempting
  `import "@intx/tools-mail"` from outside the loader would fail to
  resolve a public subpath. Operators publishing their own packages
  through the asset substrate can preserve `exports` if they want
  standalone consumability; the workspace builtins deliberately do
  not.

## REST surface

| Operation            | Endpoint                                                                                |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create the asset row | `POST /api/tenants/:tid/assets` with `{ kind: "package-registry", name }`               |
| Upload a tarball     | `PUT /api/tenants/:tid/assets/:assetId/tarballs/:filename` (`application/octet-stream`) |
| List tarballs        | `GET /api/tenants/:tid/assets/:assetId/tarballs`                                        |
| Delete a tarball     | `DELETE /api/tenants/:tid/assets/:assetId/tarballs/:filename`                           |

`bin/publish-tool-packages.ts` is the reference REST client for this
surface.

## Registry vs asset

| Concern         | Asset-sourced                                                  | Registry-sourced                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Distribution    | Operator commits the tarball to the asset repo.                | Sidecar fetches at apply time from a configured registry.             |
| Trust           | Git-commit signature on the asset.                             | Registry trust + manifest integrity pin.                              |
| Reproducibility | Strong — the bytes are vendored.                               | Strong as long as the registry honors immutability of `name@version`. |
| Use case        | Operator-curated tools, anything the operator wants to vendor. | Public packages, third-party tools, anything not vendored.            |

Either source kind is valid for any entry. A closure may mix both: the
top-level pin can be asset-sourced while a transitive dep is fetched
from a registry.
