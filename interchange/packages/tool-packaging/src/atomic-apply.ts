// Apply protocol for a ToolPackageManifest.
//
// Each apply materializes its closure into a stable, per-deploy-id
// directory that is never moved:
//
//   <instanceDir>/packages/<deploy-id>/store/<name>/<version>/...
//
// The loader dynamic-imports each pinned package's `interchange.tools`
// module from an absolute path inside that deploy-id directory. Because
// the directory is never renamed, the URL Node keys its ESM module
// cache under stays valid for the life of the deploy: a tool package
// that uses `import.meta.url`, `require.resolve()`, or a call-time
// `await import("./sibling.js")` resolves against a path that still
// exists. (The earlier protocol staged under `pending/` and renamed
// `pending/` → `active/` after import; the renamed-away URL ENOENTed
// any late path resolution. This module exists to remove that swap.)
//
// This module does NOT commit. It stages, loads, validates, and
// returns the loaded packages plus the deploy-id directory. The commit
// point lives one layer up: the caller writes the instance's
// `active-deploy-id` file to name `newDeployId`. Until that write
// lands, the instance is still running `previousDeployId`, whose
// directory is left untouched here. The "atomic swap" is therefore the
// single `active-deploy-id` file write the caller performs, not a
// directory rename.
//
// Retention. A prelude sweep removes every `packages/<id>/` except
// `{newDeployId, previousDeployId}`. The keep set is invariant across
// the caller's commit: before the commit the live deploy is
// `previousDeployId`; after it the live deploy is `newDeployId` and
// `previousDeployId` is the retained prior tree. So a single sweep at
// the start of the apply both bounds disk to ~2 closures and preserves
// exactly the prior deploy as a liveness window for any session still
// draining against it.
//
// Retention invariant: the previous deploy's directory must survive
// until the next apply, because a session built against it may still
// perform a call-time `await import()` into its tree. The next apply's
// prelude reaps it. This is safe only because per-agent applies are
// serialized (the hub runs one apply per `agentAddress` at a time) and
// each successful apply replaces the running harness, so by the time
// apply N+2 reaps deploy N, generation-N's harness teardown has
// completed and no live code references deploy N's tree.
//
// Caller responsibilities (not handled here):
//
//   - Writing `active-deploy-id` to commit the staged deploy.
//   - Constructing the WebSocket frame from the returned error.
//   - Writing the rejected manifest + error to the sidecar's git audit
//     trail under `audit/rejected-applies/<attemptId>/`.
//
// Crash safety. Boot never reads a deploy-id directory: the harness
// rebuilds by re-running the apply against the current manifest into a
// fresh deploy id. A half-written `packages/<newDeployId>/` left by a
// crash mid-build is therefore self-healing — the next boot
// re-materializes into a new id and the prelude sweep reclaims the
// orphan. Only `active-deploy-id` needs durability, and the caller owns
// that. Consequently this module fsyncs nothing.
//
// Cross-apply ESM module-identity: Node keys its ESM cache by resolved
// URL. Per-deploy-id directories already make every apply's import URL
// unique, so a reused `(name, version)` whose bytes changed across
// applies resolves to a distinct path. The loader additionally
// cache-busts each import URL with an `?integrity=<sri>` query string;
// that remains correct (and harmless) under per-deploy-id paths.
