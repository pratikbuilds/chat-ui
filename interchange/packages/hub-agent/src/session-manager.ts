// Per-agent on-disk repo operations for supervised deployments.

// The in-process session runtime -- harness construction, agent
// provisioning, disk restore, and per-agent mail audit -- has been
// retired: every agent now runs as a supervised workflow-process child
// on the workflow-run substrate. What remains here is the thin
// serialization layer over the agent repo store that the deploy path
// and the hub-link still call: deploy/asset-pack applies, state-pack
// reads, and directory teardown, each run one-at-a-time per agent so a
// teardown never races an in-flight git op.
