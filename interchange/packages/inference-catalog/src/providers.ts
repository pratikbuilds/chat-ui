// relays. Distinct
// priorities give source resolution a deterministic order across the
// deployments of a shared model. The anthropic and google-genai adapters carry
// no accommodations, so those offerings ship an empty quirks bag. OpenAI Direct
// serves gpt-5.x, which rejects `max_tokens`, so it carries
// OPENAI_FIRSTPARTY_QUIRKS. The openai-compatible relay offerings that advertise
// reasoning carry OPENAI_REASONING_QUIRKS; gpt-5.4-mini, which advertises only
// structured output, ships an empty bag. xAI Direct serves the grok models on
// the same openai-compatible wire: its reasoning offerings carry
// OPENAI_REASONING_QUIRKS, and grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning, which surfaces no
// reasoning, ships an empty bag.
// Shared capability bags for the model families the catalog serves. Each
// offering's baked `capabilities` is the matrix wire set for its discovery
// source followed by its curated tags; the families below repeat the same wire
// set across many offerings, so the lists live here once and each offering
// references its family bag (or a spread appending the curated `long-context`
// tag). The guard test still re-bakes every offering from its provenance tuple
// and fails if any of these bags drifts from the discovery matrix.
