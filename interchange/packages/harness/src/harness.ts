// The harness imports `@intx/agent` and composes a mail-transport
// surface on top of `createAgent(def, env)`. The reactor is wrapped
// exactly once -- inside the agent harness in `@intx/agent`. This
// module owns transport subscription, the connector router and its
// state persistence, the INBOX watch loop, and the outbound side of
// `connector.reply` events.
//
// What this module does *not* own: reactor wrapping, audit accumulation
// or flushing, source-registry hot-swap. Those live in `@intx/agent`
// and are reached via `agent.deliver`, `agent.setSource`, and
// `agent.stream()` respectively.

/**
 * Env extension the composition layer requires beyond `BaseEnv`. Tools
 * shipped by this package declare the matching `requires` so
 * `validateEnv` can blame either at the env entry point.
 *
 * `onReplySendFailed` is invoked when the reply drain catches a failure
 * from `connectorRouter.composeReply` or `transport.send` for an
 * outbound `connector.reply`. The reply is dropped and the router
 * state is not advanced; the callback is the only programmatic surface
 * a caller has to observe the loss. Production deployments that need
 * retry semantics layer them on top of this callback.
 *
 * The callback may be synchronous or async; the reply drain awaits its
 * resolution so an async callback's rejection is observed (and logged)
 * rather than surfacing as an unhandled promise rejection.
 *
 * `onReplyDrainTerminated` is invoked when the reply drain's `for await`
 * loop exits abnormally -- the only documented case is a
 * `StreamBackpressureError` thrown by the agent's event stream when the
 * drain's per-consumer buffer overruns `streamBufferMax`. After this
 * fires the harness is no longer forwarding `connector.reply` events to
 * the transport: in-process `agent.send()` callers still resolve, but
 * outbound replies are silently dropped until `close()`. Production
 * deployments that need to alert on this failure mode subscribe via
 * this callback; the harness only emits a `logger.warn` otherwise. The
 * callback may be synchronous or async and is awaited the same way
 * `onReplySendFailed` is, so an async rejection is observed (and
 * logged) rather than escaping as an unhandled rejection.

/**
 * Construct an `AnnotatedToolFactory` for a mail-tool bundle. The

 * underlying mail tools is the caller's responsibility (the env is the
 * agent's dependency contract; the caller owns what it puts in env);
 * the agent itself does not call bundle disposers (see the
 * `ToolBundle` contract in `@intx/agent`). Callers that need to
 * dispose mail tools on shutdown retain a reference to the underlying
 * `MailToolWrapper`'s output and invoke its `dispose` directly --
 * routing disposal through the bundle the agent receives would still
 * not fire since the agent never holds it.
 *
 * The `requires: ["transport", "address"]` declaration captures the
 * env-key surface of the entire mail composition path -- the factory
 * body reads `transport`, and `createHarness` (which the caller pairs
 * this factory with) reads `env.address` to label rejected-message
 * log records identifying which agent's router refused the message.
 * No routing decision keys off `env.address` -- the connector router
 * routes on per-message thread state, not on the agent's own
 * address -- so the field is observability-only. It still belongs in
 * `requires` because the harness's log record assumes the field is
 * populated; declaring it here lets the agent's `validateEnv` blame a
 * missing `address` at construction time rather than letting the
 * watch loop discover it under operational load. Callers that hand-
 * build a `defineTool` factory for a different mail-tool runner must
 * remember to surface `address` on their own `requires` if their
 * `createHarness` consumes it -- the agent has no way to deduce
 * composition-layer env requirements from a factory body that does
 * not itself read the field.
 *
 * The `requires` set is fixed at the two keys above by design; this
 * helper is not the extension point for mail-tool runners that need
 * additional env keys. A mail tool that wants to read (say) a tenant
 * identifier from env should drop down to `defineTool` directly,
 * declare its own `requires` with the full surface, and call the
 * underlying mail-tool constructor inside that factory. Folding an
 * additional `requires` parameter into `defineMailTools` would push
 * the "what does the harness need vs. what does the tool runner
 * need" partition onto the caller, which is exactly the partition
 * this helper exists to hide.
 *
 * `definitions` is the static declaration `defineTool` requires: the
 * tool names this factory contributes, enumerable without invoking the
 * wrapper. The caller supplies it because the wrapper binds `transport`
 * from env and cannot run at declaration time; the caller already holds
 * the mail-tool runner whose `definitions` name the same tools.
