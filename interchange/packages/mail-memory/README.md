# @intx/mail-memory

In-memory `MessageTransport` for single-process and test
environments. A single transport instance hosts every address in
the process; each registered address gets its own per-recipient
transport handle that signs outbound mail with the provided
`CryptoProvider` and delivers inbound mail straight to the
recipient's INBOX.

Consumed by examples, tests, and the in-process `@intx/agent`
runtime. The on-the-wire format matches `@intx/mime` so a fixture
captured here can be replayed against a real transport without
modification.

```ts
import { createInMemoryTransport } from "@intx/mail-memory";
import { createEd25519Crypto, generateKeyPair } from "@intx/crypto";

const transport = createInMemoryTransport();
const alpha = createEd25519Crypto(await generateKeyPair());
const beta = createEd25519Crypto(await generateKeyPair());

transport.register("alpha@local.interchange", alpha);
transport.register("beta@local.interchange", beta);

const alphaMail = transport.getTransportFor("alpha@local.interchange");
await alphaMail.send({
  to: "beta@local.interchange",
  type: "conversation.message",
  content: "hello",
});
```

Install a `RemoteSendHandler` via `transport.setRemoteSendHandler`
to forward outbound mail for addresses the transport does not host
locally. The handler receives the raw message, remote recipients, and
the sender address already validated by the scoped transport. Add one or
more `MessageSentHandler`s via `transport.addMessageSentHandler` for
post-send observability.
