// A run id enters the system at `runtimeRun` and is used verbatim as a
// durable-store path segment and a mail-address local part, so it is validated
// against `RUN_ID_PATTERN` at that boundary. `runLocal` forwards a caller
// `runId` straight through, so it is the seam that exercises the guard.
