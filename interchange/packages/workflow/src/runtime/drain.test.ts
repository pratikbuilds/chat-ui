// Drain controller and four-observation-point tests.
//
// The runtime body observes drain at exactly four sites: main loop
// entry, retry-between-attempts inside runStep, waitForTimer, and
// runAwaitSignal. Each site reads `shouldAbortForDrain(drain, stepId)`
// and aborts the step's local controller when the drain signal has
// fired AND the step's declared `drainBehavior` is `"cancel"`. A
// `"wait"`-behavior step ignores drain.
//
// These tests construct a custom env so the test can flip a
// controllable drain controller mid-flight and assert behavior at
// each observation point.
