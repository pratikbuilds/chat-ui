// Loop-iteration env shaping for the suspendable-child seam.
//
// A loop iteration runs its body through the SAME `SuspendableChildHandle`
// contract an onTrigger section body uses, but with a different env: it INHERITS
// the parent run's env -- the real `invokeStep` (tools), `invokeAction`,
// `authorize` (parent grants), `effects`, and the durable shared
// `repoStore`/`blobs` -- so tool, action, grant, and inference-source behaviour
// matches the in-process iteration this replaces. An onTrigger body, by
// contrast, runs in a fresh capped env; a loop is the parent's own
// bounded rework, so parent-env inheritance is what it IS.
//
// Two things are NOT inherited:
//   - a fresh, iteration-OWNED signalChannel (supplied by the host, in-memory
//     locally / substrate-backed on the deployed path). Sharing the parent's
//     channel would put the body's `awaitSignal` awaits and the container's
//     relay awaits on one FIFO name, racing delivery.
//   - `onPark`/`onSignalPark`, which `createSuspendableChildHandle` owns: the
//     body's parks feed the handle's queue for the container to proxy up, not
//     the parent env's supervisor-facing `onPark`.
// One inherited field is nonetheless restated on the child env rather than
// left to the spread:
//   - `hasUpstreamSignalResolver`. A loop iteration is answerable exactly when
//     its container is, and `parkOnSignalResult` reads that field to refuse an
//     untimed gate nothing can answer. Carrying it silently would leave the
//     other half of that guard invisible from here, where a future change to
//     the spread could drop it without a reader noticing.
// Everything else -- including `readParkedApprovalOps`, the child's own
// mid-park crash-recovery read hook -- is inherited unchanged.
