// The canonical walk over the steps a workflow definition can execute.
//
// `stepOrder` lists only the steps of ONE definition record. A workflow's
// executable surface is larger: a `loop` carries an inline body, and an inline
// `onTrigger` section or `childWorkflow` carries a full nested definition. A
// consumer that answers "which steps run here" off `stepOrder` alone therefore
// under-counts every nested body, and a consumer that hand-rolls its own
// recursion drifts from every other one the first time a primitive kind is
// added. This module owns the traversal so neither happens.
//
// Three properties the walk is built around:
//
//   - The set of bodies to descend into is an EXPLICIT argument
//     (`StepWalkDescent`), never an implicit house rule. The two descents in
//     use are named constants with documented meanings, because a consumer's
//     answer changes with the setting and a caller that cannot name its
//     setting cannot be reconciled with another caller's.
//   - `nestedWorkflowBodies` dispatches over an EXHAUSTIVE switch with a
//     `never` assignment. A newly-added primitive kind fails at compile time
//     rather than silently reading as a leaf: the deploy-time capability walk
//     descends through here to collect a nested closure's grants, and a missed
//     container kind there is a silent, fail-open authorization gap. The
//     compiler, not a remembered call site, owns that coverage.
//   - The walk knows every step's ancestor chain, so it HANDS THAT CHAIN OVER
//     (`StepWalkEntry.path`) instead of leaving a consumer to rebuild it from
//     the order the walk calls back in. A rebuilt position would pin the
//     traversal's internal call order as an unwritten contract.
//
// The traversal core (`walkStepTree`) is generic over the step and tree types
// so it also serves the inert wire projection, whose steps are `unknown` and
// are validated by the caller as it descends. Only the live-definition
// descent (`nestedWorkflowBodies`) can be typed, so only it carries the
// exhaustive switch.
