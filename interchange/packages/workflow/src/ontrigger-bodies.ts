// Structural extraction of inline onTrigger section bodies.
//
// An onTrigger primitive carries its section body either inline (the authored
// form) or as a `{ ref }` to a separately-deployed body definition. The
// runtime only dispatches a `{ ref }` body -- an inline body reaching the
// runtime is a deploy-step bug (see `runOnTrigger`). This module performs the
// pure structural rewrite: replace each inline body with a `{ ref }` and return
// the extracted body definitions.
//
// It carries NO deploy machinery (no capability walk, no source-pinning, no hub
// write), so the callers that run it over a RE-EVALUATED closure -- the
// source-ref run child and the sidecar deploy router, which have neither a
// director registry nor the operator approval set -- share one exact structural
// rewrite, kept separate from the capability walk and source-pinning the deploy
// layers on elsewhere.

 * that ref could alias a top-level step literally named
 * `<loopStepId>__<childStepId>`. The live rewrite/enumeration
 * here and the source-ref hub's inert-body enumerator both mint refs through it,
 * and the source-ref run child re-derives the same ref when it rewrites the
 * re-evaluated closure (`run-child`). A hub that records a body's sources under
 * this ref and a run child that looks them up must agree byte-for-byte, so the
 * scheme lives in one place rather than being re-spelled at each site.

 * `WorkflowDefinition` that both hash layers project inline (`projectForHash`
 * and the deploy-side `projectLoop`), so replacing it with a `{ ref }` would
 * change every existing loop's hash. This enumerator instead mints a fresh copy
 * (`{ ...body, id: ref }`) for the runtime bodies map and leaves `primitive.body`
 * byte-identical -- the suspendable-child seam resolves a loop body by ref while
 * the definition's hash is unchanged. Pure and side-effect-free.
 *
 * The scan RECURSES into each loop body so a nested loop's body is registered
 * too, under `inlineBodyRef(<parentBodyRef>, <innerLoopId>)` -- the exact ref
 * `runLoop` derives at runtime (`inlineBodyRef(definition.id, primitive.id)`)
 * when the inner loop runs inside the outer body's own run. A loop body inherits
 * the parent env, so an inner loop resolves its ref from this single top-level
 * map; the map must therefore carry every depth. The recursion follows loop
 * bodies only: a `childWorkflow` inside a loop body is a separate child run whose
 * own loops enumerate when its run boots, so this scan stops at that boundary.
 * It also stays a pure loop-body LIFT (grandchildren still inline) -- the host
 * rewrites each returned body's `childWorkflow` children itself and keeps the
 * pre-rewrite form for the grant cap, which a rewrite folded in here would break.
