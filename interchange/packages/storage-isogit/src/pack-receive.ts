/**
 * Atomically publish a packfile into a git repository's pack directory.
 *
 * # Race being addressed
 *
 * `git.indexPack` writes the `.idx` file with a single non-atomic
 * `fs.write` (see `_indexPack` at
 * `node_modules/isomorphic-git/index.cjs:11953`). Pack discovery walks
 * `objects/pack/` enumerating `*.idx` files non-recursively (see
 * `readObjectPacked` at `node_modules/isomorphic-git/index.cjs:3394-3398`
 * and the sibling enumerator at `:9286-9290`) and, for each one,
 * derives the matching `.pack` filename and reads it. A concurrent
 * reader landing during the `.idx` write can observe either a truncated
 * buffer (surfacing as `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating
 * 'this.buffer.slice')` inside iso-git's `BufferCursor`) or an `.idx`
 * that does not yet list the OID being looked for (surfacing as
 * `NotFoundError`).
 *
 * # Invariant maintained
 *
 * At every point at which an `.idx` is visible to a reader's directory
 * scan of `objects/pack/`, the `.pack` it references is fully written
 * and findable under the filename the reader will derive from the
 * `.idx`. Equivalently: readers see either no new pack at all, or the
 * fully-published `.pack` + `.idx` pair. There is no observable
 * intermediate state.
 *
 * # Strategy: stage outside the scanned directory
 *
 * The mid-write race is fundamental to `indexPack` writing its output
 * file in-place. The only way to keep readers from observing it is to
 * write the `.idx` somewhere readers do not scan. iso-git's enumerator
 * scans only the literal path `<gitdir>/objects/pack` and only
 * non-recursively (verified at the source line refs above), so any
 * sibling directory under `objects/` is invisible to discovery.
 *
 * We stage in `objects/pack-staging/<transferId>/`. The per-transfer
 * subdirectory keeps concurrent receives' temp pairs isolated from each
 * other. It shares a storage namespace with the final `objects/pack/`
 * directory, so the runtime's atomic rename contract applies between them.
 *
 * # Sequence (numbered for cross-reference with cleanup contract)
 *
 *   1. Create `objects/pack-staging/<transferId>/` and write the pack
 *      bytes to `pack.pack` inside it. Readers scanning
 *      `objects/pack/` do not see this file (different directory).
 *
 *   2. Run `git.indexPack` against the staging path — iso-git derives
 *      the `.idx` filename from the `.pack` filename and writes
 *      `pack.idx` next to it inside the staging directory. The
 *      non-atomic `.idx` write happens here but the file is in the
 *      staging directory, so concurrent readers scanning
 *      `objects/pack/` cannot observe the in-progress write.
 *
 *   3. Atomic publish (transitions readers from "no new pack" to "new
 *      pack visible"):
 *
 *        a. Atomically rename staging `.pack` -> final `.pack`. The new
 *           `.pack` now exists in `objects/pack/`. Readers scanning
 *           for `.idx` files still do not see the new pack (no `.idx`
 *           for it in `objects/pack/` yet). The staging `.pack`
 *           directory entry vanishes.
 *
 *        b. Atomically rename staging `.idx` -> final `.idx`. The new `.idx`
 *           appears atomically in `objects/pack/`; readers' next
 *           directory scan finds it and resolves the `.pack` written
 *           in 3a. The staging directory's `.idx` entry vanishes;
 *           since nothing was reading from the staging directory in
 *           the first place, this transition is observable only to
 *           this function.
 *
 *        c. Remove the now-empty staging directory.
 *
 *   4. On any throw before publish completes, recursively remove the
 *      staging directory. Forced recursive removal tolerates partial states
 *      (e.g. throw mid-write before `.idx` exists, or throw inside
 *      `indexPack`).
 *
 * # Cleanup contract
 *
 * On successful return, no staging files remain. On throw before
 * publish (steps 1-2), the staging directory and any files inside it
 * are removed. A throw partway through publish (between 3a and 3b)
 * leaves an unindexed `.pack` in `objects/pack/`; this is
 * harmless (iso-git ignores `.pack` files with no matching `.idx`,
 * verified at `index.cjs:3394-3398`) and the recovery path on the next
 * call would re-write the same content. The cleanup-on-throw path
 * here attempts to remove the orphan `.pack` but does not mask the
 * original publish error.
 *
 * # Validation timing
 *
 * Callers that need to inspect the pack's contents (`git.readCommit`,
 * `git.readTree`, signature verification against raw object bytes)
 * must do so *after* this function returns: the pack lives in the
 * staging directory until publish, so iso-git's pack discovery does
 * not find it until step 3 completes.
 *
 * Callers that reject the published pack (signature failure, tree
 * validator rejection, sha mismatch, CAS non-fast-forward) call
 * `unpublishPack` to remove the published `.pack` + `.idx` pair from
 * `objects/pack/`. A concurrent reader that already loaded the rejected
 * pack can finish against those bytes, while subsequent calls no longer
 * discover the pair.
 *
 * # Scope
 *
 * This helper does not own the lock that serializes concurrent
 * receives on the same `dir`. Callers serialize at a higher layer
 * (e.g. `withRepoLock` in
 * `packages/hub-sessions/src/repo-store/store.ts`). The atomicity
 * guarantee here is against arbitrary `dir`-level isomorphic-git reads
 * issued from any code that shares the filesystem — including code
 * that does not consult the caller's lock (e.g. tests that call
 * `git.readCommit` directly).
 *
 * # Forward compatibility
 *
 * If isomorphic-git's `_indexPack` becomes atomic upstream (writes the
 * `.idx` via temp+rename internally), or if pack discovery moves to a
 * different mechanism, this staging dance becomes redundant and can
 * collapse back to writing directly into `objects/pack/`. The cited
 * source-line references above are the verification anchor for the
 * next reader deciding whether the dance is still needed.

/**
 * Apply a git packfile to a repository, check out the working tree, and
 * update the ref.
 *
 * Writes the pack to .git/objects/pack/ (the standard location for git
 * packfiles), creates the .idx index via indexPack, checks out the tree to
 * the working directory, then updates `ref` to point at `expectedSha`.
 * The ref is written last so it never points at a commit whose working tree
 * has not been materialized.
 *
 * When `verifyCommit` is provided, the commit's embedded signature is
 * verified before the working tree is materialized. Throws with a message
 * prefixed by `"signature_unsigned"` if the commit has no signature, or
 * `"signature_invalid"` if verification fails. Only omit `verifyCommit`
 * for state packs that follow their own signing model.
 *
 * Throws if the expected commit is not found in the pack.
 *
 * The caller is responsible for ensuring `dir` is an initialized git repo.
