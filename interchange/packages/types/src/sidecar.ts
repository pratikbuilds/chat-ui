//
// Git pack data is streamed between hub and sidecar over the existing JSON
// WebSocket. Chunks are base64-encoded (matching the mail convention above).
// A transfer is a sequence of repo.pack.push frames followed by a
// repo.pack.done, correlated by transferId. The receiver responds with
// repo.pack.ack or repo.pack.reject.
//
// Each pack frame carries two complementary addressing fields:
//
//   - `agentAddress` identifies the destination agent on the receiving
//     sidecar. The sidecar manages per-agent state and uses this field to
//     route the pack to the correct workspace. For agent-state packs the
//     sidecar applies the pack onto the agent's deploy/state tree.
//
//   - `repoId` identifies the source repo at the hub. The hub maps `repoId`
//     to the originating entry in its kind-keyed RepoStore. For
//     `repoId.kind === "agent-state"`, `repoId.id` is the run address
//     (the deploy/state repo and the destination agent are the same), so
//     the two fields carry the same value. Future kinds (e.g. assets) use
//     `repoId` to name a non-agent source while `agentAddress` continues
//     to address the destination agent.
//
// Flow control: deferred. Agent deploy trees are small enough that the sender
// can push all chunks without windowing. If this becomes a problem, a credit-
// based mechanism can be added later.

 *                              cover. Indicates a mismatch between the

 *                              manifest's pinned SRI integrity.
 *   registry.fetch.failed    — the configured registry refused or

 *   registry.unknown         — the manifest entry references a registry

 *   manifest.invalid         — the manifest itself did not validate
 *                              at the loader boundary (JSON.parse
 *                              failure or arktype schema failure).

 *                              no `interchange.tools` field.
 *   package.entry.invalid    — the resolved `interchange.tools` module

 *                              a capability key the env did not provide.
 *   tool.name.duplicate      — a tool name is registered more than

 *                              failure) differs.
 *   apply.swap.failed        — DEPRECATED, no longer emitted. The apply
 *                              protocol stages each deploy into a stable
 *                              per-deploy-id directory and commits via a
 *                              single `active-deploy-id` file write, so
 *                              there is no filesystem rename that can

 *                              for wire compatibility: during a rolling
 *                              upgrade an older sidecar can still emit
 *                              it, and dropping the member would make a
 *                              newer hub's frame validator reject that
 *                              frame.
 *   apply.previous-rotation.failed
 *                            — every loaded factory validated and the
 *                              new deploy was staged, but persisting the
 *                              instance's `active-deploy-id` file (the
 *                              commit) degraded: the id was written
 *                              through the no-fsync / dirty-marker
 *                              fallback ladder rather than durably
