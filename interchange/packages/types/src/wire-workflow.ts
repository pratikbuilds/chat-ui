 * `definition` is the wire projection of `WorkflowDefinition` from

 * envelope the workflow-process child re-parses on the sidecar after
 * materialization (`packages/hub-sessions/src/workflow-kind.ts`'s
 * `workflowDefinitionEnvelopeSchema`): `id`, `triggers`, `steps`,
 * `stepOrder`, optional `state`. The wire validator MUST require every
 * field the envelope requires — this projection is the approved surface
 * the source-ref child re-verifies its closure-evaluated definition
 * against, and the child rejects a tree missing any envelope-required
 * field. Deeper validation of authoring-time primitive shape lives on the
 * workflow definition surface in `@intx/workflow`, not on the wire.
 *
 * `sources` pins an ordered, non-empty inference-source list per step in
 * `definition.stepOrder` so the workflow-process child can resolve inference
 * at step invocation without a round trip to the hub. The list is the step's
 * failover chain: element 0 is the active source (its id is the step's
 * `defaultSource`), and the reactor fails over forward through the tail on a
 * transient inference error. A workflow step pins a single-element list (no
 * per-step failover); a single-agent instance pins the instance's full
 * ordered source chain. Every `stepOrder` entry must have a matching
 * `sources` entry; the validator rejects frames that violate this at the
 * boundary.
