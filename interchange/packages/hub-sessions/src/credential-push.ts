// Hub-side producers that push credential-material changes to running
// deployments over `credentials.update`.
//
// Two shapes, one per removal semantic:
//   - Source re-resolve (`pushSourceUpdates`, `pushSourceUpdatesSubtree`): after
//     a credential secret rotation or a catalog edit, re-resolve each running
//     instance's inference sources and push the refreshed material followed by
//     the `sources.update` that references it. An inference source references
//     its credential by id only, so the rotated secret rides the cell.
//   - Flat named revoke (`pushCredentialRevoke`): after a credential is deleted
//     or deliberately revoked, broadcast a `revoke` naming that credentialId so
//     every running deployment drops it. The removed id is NAMED by the actor,
//     so this needs no diff against a prior delivery.
