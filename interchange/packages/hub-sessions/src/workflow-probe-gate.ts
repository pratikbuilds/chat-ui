// Hub-side install/approve orchestration and gate for a code-sourced workflow
// definition.
//
// This is the production glue that turns a code-sourced workflow install into
// an approved, frozen definition WITHOUT executing any author code on the hub.
// Everything here operates over the inert projection and grant set the sidecar
// returns from a probe:
//
//   1. Resolve the frozen dependency closure for the definition's pin.
//   2. Probe the sidecar for the definition's inert needs-surface projection,
//      its advisory grant set, and the content hash the sidecar shipped.
//   3. RECOMPUTE the wire hash over the RECEIVED projection as tamper-evidence:
//      a shipped hash that differs from the hub recompute is rejected, fail
//      closed, no coercion.
//   4. Reject a projection declaring a trigger type the runtime does not
//      implement, so a deployment that could only ever sit inert never gets
//      approved.
//   5. Reject a projection carrying a step the grant walk left no record for,
//      so no deployment can schedule a step whose grants nobody approved.
//   6. Gate the advisory grant set AND the definition's declared grant
//      requirements against the approval policy: an operator `ApprovalSet`
//      requires every grant the probe surfaced and every requirement it
//      declared to be approved or the gate fails, while `approve-probed`
//      approves exactly what the probe surfaced.
//   7. Freeze the approved wire hash onto the definition version row, keyed by
//      the definition's selector, and return the frozen approved grant set.
//
// The frozen approved set is the single source of truth for the definition's
// grants: the deploy path materializes deploy grants as a SUBSET of it (never a
// fresh walk), so a workflow can never acquire at deploy or run time a grant it
// did not have frozen at approval. The wire hash is that freeze's anchor -- the
// grant set is a deterministic projection of the exact content the hash
// addresses, so pinning the hash pins the set.

 * moved between approve and deploy would pin different bytes and project
 * differently, failing the child re-verify -- so both ride from approve verbatim.

 *
 * The operator-approval decision is an input (`approvals`): the caller supplies
 * either the `ApprovalSet` the operator approved, which the gate holds the
 * advisory set to, or `approve-probed` to approve exactly the surface the probe
 * reports.
 *
 * Returns the gate outcome alongside the inert projection and the frozen
 * closure so the deploy hand-off consumes them verbatim rather than re-probing
 * or re-resolving.
