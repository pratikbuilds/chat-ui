   * log) uses this to skip re-validating subtrees the commit provably
   * did not touch; a handler with no such structure ignores it and
   * validates unconditionally.
   *
   * `priorListDirOids` mirrors `priorListDir` but returns each child
   * entry's git object id alongside its name, read straight from the

   * already carries the OID). A handler that validates a large retained

   * `listDirOids` is the prospective-side mirror of `priorListDirOids`:
   * each child entry's OID read straight from the prospective tree's
   * listing, so a handler comparing a retained subtree by OID gets the
   * prospective OID without re-reading and hashing every entry's bytes.
   * It is `undefined` on paths that do not surface it (a hand-built
   * validatePush in a test), in which case the handler falls back to
