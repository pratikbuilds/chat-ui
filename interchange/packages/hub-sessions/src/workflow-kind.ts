// KindHandler for the `workflow` asset kind.
//
// A workflow asset is a codebase: a top-level `package.json` declaring an
// `interchange.workflow` entry module plus arbitrary source files. The sidecar
// materializes the codebase into a closure and evaluates the pinned entry to the
// definition. `validatePush` requires the `package.json`; a tree that lacks one
// is rejected. The legacy `workflow.json` envelope form is no longer accepted at
// the push boundary.
//
// Source files are unconstrained, but the push validates the manifest's shape
// and the entry-path's containment, and refuses an envelope-only
// `capability-declarations.json`, a committed `node_modules`, and an ambiguous
// tree that also carries an envelope-valid `workflow.json`, so one asset resolves
// to exactly one definition. The codebase shape accepts both a single package and
// a `workspaces` monorepo; for a monorepo the push validates only the root's
// well-formedness and leaves per-member validation to the resolver.
//
// Authz:
//   - hub principal: full access.
//   - sidecar principal: read-only (createPack, resolveRef).
//   - user principal: gated by bearer-token claims and the route
//     layer's pre-resolved authz verdict, mirroring the convention
//     used by skill assets.
