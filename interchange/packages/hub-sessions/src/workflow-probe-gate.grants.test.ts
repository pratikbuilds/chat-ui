// The approval gate's coverage of DECLARED GRANT REQUIREMENTS.
//
// A definition's declared requirements ride
// `probeResult.grantWalkSnapshot.grantRequirements`, a sibling of `projection`
// on the probe frame. They are not represented in `probeResult.grants`: the
// capability walk (`walkCapabilities`) never reads them, so the flattened walk
// surface cannot carry them. They are also outside the wire-hash preimage (the
// hash covers `projection` alone), so tamper-evidence says nothing about them
// either. The operator's decision is therefore the only thing standing between
// a declared requirement and the freeze.
//
// That matters because a frozen requirement is not an inert record. Both
// run-time materialization sites (the external trigger route and the
// mail-triggered run path) read the frozen list back and mint real grant rows
// onto the run principal from it, which ship to the child as the run's
// `stepGrants`.
//
// These cases assert the fail-closed property: a requirement the operator did
// not approve must be named in the rejection and must freeze nothing, a
// requirement the operator DID approve must pass, and an `approve-probed`
// approval must account for the requirement in the approval it returns.
