 * that owns its routing address and public key. Run-grant materialization keys
 * off this row (address + live status), so WITHOUT it no per-run grants (tool,
 * capability, OR credential) ever materialize for a source-ref deployment. Born
 * "deployed" (live but pre-trigger) with a null public key: the first trigger's
 * materialization flips it to "running" via `anchorWithPrincipal`'s guarded
 * update, which a row born "running" would skip. Its `anchorRunId` equals its
 * own id, so the anchor references itself. The deployer read grant is deferred
 * to the production route, which carries the authenticated deployer principal.
 *
 * ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING. The anchor row must be committed and visible to the
 * pack-receipt connection BEFORE the frame reaches the wire: the frame spawns
 * the child, whose first events pack races the ack back, and
 * `receiveWorkflowRunPack` fails closed on a missing live anchor. Emitting first
 * (the previous order) rejected that first pack and never bootstrapped the log.
 * This works because `args.db` is the autocommit handle (`DB["db"]`, which the
 * type forbids from being a transaction) and the INSERT is NOT wrapped in a
 * transaction with the emit -- so the row is durably visible the instant the
 * INSERT statement returns. Do NOT relax `db` to a transaction executor or wrap
 * anchor+emit in one transaction to make them atomic: that reopens the race.
 *
 * On emit failure the anchor row is rolled back or fenced by the `frameSent`
 * evidence from the transport. `leakedAgent: false` (safe to fully roll back) is
 * the STRONG claim and is made only on positive proof the frame never reached
 * the wire (`isDeployFrameFailure && frameSent === false`); every other failure
 * -- a sent-but-unacked frame OR any untagged error -- is treated as
 * possibly-live: the anchor is fenced `deployed` -> `failed` and the error is
 * `leakedAgent: true`.
 *
 * The prepared provisioned path does NOT use this composition: its anchor row
 * already exists from prepare time, so it drives `emitSourceRefDeployFrame` and
 * an UPDATE-under-allocation-lock instead.
