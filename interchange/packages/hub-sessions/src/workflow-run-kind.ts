// KindHandler for the `workflow-run` repo kind.
//
// A workflow-run repo holds per-deployment runtime state for one or
// more in-flight workflow runs. `RepoId.id` is the owning deployment
// id. The repo's top-level layout is:
//
//   - `runs/<runId>/events/<seq>.json` — per-run event log entries.
//     Each entry is a JSON object whose body carries a `type`
//     discriminator (the on-disk event vocabulary used by the
//     workflow-run repo) and a `seq` field that matches the integer
//     in the filename. Filenames are decimal integers ranging from
//     `0` upward; the on-disk seq numbering owns the ordering and
//     the per-blob `seq` field is the redundant cross-check.
//   - `runs/<runId>/blobs/<sha256-hex>` — content-addressed step
//     outputs the production `BlobSubstrate` adapter spills here when
//     a value's JSON-stringified form exceeds the inline-encoding
//     threshold. The filename is a lowercase 64-character sha256 hex
//     string; the blob value is opaque bytes. Blobs are append-only
//     and immutable: any blob present in the prior tree must carry
//     byte-identical contents in the prospective tree.
//   - `addresses/<urlEncoded(address)>/inbox/<receivedAt>-<messageId>.json`
//     — pending inbound mail for the address, FIFO-ordered by the
//     filename's parsed numeric `receivedAt` prefix (with a
//     lexicographic messageId tiebreak). The filename keeps the
//     decimal `<receivedAt>` form unpadded; the substrate sorts by
//     parsed integer rather than string so the FIFO invariant holds
//     for non-uniform digit widths (e.g. `99-…` precedes `100-…`).
//   - `addresses/<urlEncoded(address)>/processing/<receivedAt>-<messageId>.json`
//     — messages currently being handled. Same filename shape and
//     JSON envelope as the inbox entry; a `dequeueToProcessing`
//     commit atomically removes the inbox entry and adds the
//     processing entry preserving the filename key.
//   - `addresses/<urlEncoded(address)>/consumed/<messageId>.json` —
//     dedup index keyed by messageId. A `markConsumed` commit
//     atomically removes the matching processing entry and writes
//     this dedup entry. The dedup index is bounded by a per-address
//     retention watermark (see `watermark.json`): a `markConsumed`
//     commit prunes consumed entries whose `receivedAt` falls below
//     the watermark so the index reaches a bounded steady state
//     instead of growing one entry per message forever.
//   - `addresses/<urlEncoded(address)>/watermark.json` — the
//     per-address retention watermark. Carries a single
//     `receivedAt`-horizon value: the oldest `receivedAt` a consumed
//     entry may still retain. The watermark only ever advances
//     (monotonic non-decreasing). `enqueueInbox` rejects any inbound
//     whose `receivedAt` is strictly below the watermark as
//     definitively-stale (its dedup entry may have been pruned, so a
//     duplicate cannot be ruled out -- refuse loudly rather than risk
//     reprocessing). Above the watermark the `consumed/` index is
//     authoritative; below it, refuse. The watermark advances only as
//     the prune advances, both under the single writer, so the two
//     never diverge. The stale-reject applies ONLY to fresh inbound at
//     `enqueueInbox`; `replayProcessingToInbox` is intentionally exempt
//     (a recovered in-flight `processing/` entry is already past dedup
//     -- see that function's note).
//   - `.gitignore` — supplied by the asset routes' genesis init body.
//
// The control-plane subtree (`control/...`) is not part of this
// commit's surface and has no v1 use case.
//
// Event-log invariants enforced at push:
//   - Each event body's `seq` matches the integer in its filename.
//   - Per-run event filenames are unique decimal integers (guaranteed
//     by the tree shape) and validatePush verifies the body's `seq`
//     field carries the same number, so the on-disk seq sequence and
//     the per-blob seq cannot diverge.
//   - Terminal-phase lock: once a run's events include a `RunCompleted`,
//     `RunFailed`, or `RunCancelled` entry, no event with a strictly
//     greater seq may appear for the same run.
//   - Append-only via prior-tree byte comparison: every event blob
//     that exists at the same path in the parent commit's tree must
//     match the prospective blob byte-for-byte. Newly-added event
//     paths (those absent from the prior tree) are accepted. The
//     substrate exposes the prior tree via `priorReadBlob` /
//     `priorListDir` on the validatePush args so the constraint is
//     owned by this handler rather than relying on caller-layer
//     discipline.
//   - A `CancelRequested` event must carry an `origin` in the known
//     set (`self`, `supervisor-drain`, `supervisor-operator`,
//     `hub-admin`) and a non-empty `reason`.
//   - Principal-vs-origin enforcement for `CancelRequested`: a
//     `hub-admin` origin requires the signing principal to be `hub`;
//     the other three
//     origins (`self`, `supervisor-drain`, `supervisor-operator`)
//     require the signing principal to be `supervisor` — the
//     supervisor signs on the child's behalf for `self`, and signs
//     for itself on the drain / operator cases. A principal that does
//     not match the declared origin produces a rejection naming both
//     sides so a misconfigured writer surfaces at the boundary
//     rather than as a downstream mystery.
//
// Claim-check subtree invariants enforced at push:
//   - The `<urlEncoded>` segment under `addresses/` must round-trip
//     cleanly through `decodeURIComponent` followed by
//     `encodeURIComponent`. A segment that does not round-trip is
//     rejected so consumers can rely on a single canonical encoding.
//   - The only entries permitted under an `addresses/<urlEncoded>/`
//     subtree are the directories `inbox`, `processing`, and
//     `consumed`, plus the single `watermark.json` file. Other names
//     under an address fail the push.
//   - Inbox and processing filenames must match
//     `<receivedAt>-<messageId>.json` where `receivedAt` is a decimal
//     epoch-ms integer. The body's `receivedAt` matches the filename
//     `receivedAt` and the body's `messageId` matches the filename
//     `messageId`. The body's `address` field must decode to the
//     URL-encoded segment.
//   - Consumed filenames must match `<messageId>.json`. The body's
//     `messageId` matches the filename `messageId`. The body carries
//     a `consumedBy` run id and the `receivedAt` of the original
//     consume for audit.
//   - Atomicity: a given `<messageId>` appears in at most one
//     filename across `inbox`, `processing`, and `consumed` combined,
//     per address per prospective commit. Two inbox entries with the
//     same `<messageId>` but different `<receivedAt>` are rejected as
//     a same-state collision; the cross-state check fires when the
//     same messageId appears in inbox+processing, inbox+consumed, or
//     processing+consumed.
//   - `consumed/<messageId>.json` bytes are immutable: a prospective
//     commit that mutates the bytes of a consumed entry RETAINED from
//     the prior tree is rejected by the same prior-tree byte-equality
//     guard used for run events. A retained consumed entry may be
//     DELETED only as a watermark-consistent retention prune (see the
//     watermark invariants below); any other deletion is rejected.
//   - Retention prune (the bounded-`consumed/` contract): the consumed
//     dedup index may shrink only by a watermark-passed prune. A
//     consumed entry present in the prior tree may be absent from the
//     prospective tree only when (a) its `receivedAt` is strictly
//     below the prospective `watermark.json` value (you may prune only
//     what the watermark passed) and (b) the watermark did not regress
//     (`prospective watermark >= prior watermark`). A RETAINED entry is
//     NOT required to sit at or above the watermark: a message consumed
//     long after receipt (or one replayed back in-flight after a crash)
//     may legitimately carry a below-watermark `receivedAt` and survive
//     until a later commit prunes it. Retaining it gives only EXTRA
//     dedup -- a re-submission at or above the watermark still hits the
//     entry, one below it is stale-rejected at enqueue -- so it never
//     weakens exactly-once.
//   - Inbox→processing transition: a processing entry that is newly
//     added (not present in the prior tree) must be backed by a
//     matching inbox entry in the prior tree at the same
//     `<receivedAt>-<messageId>.json` key. If the prior tree does
//     not show that inbox entry the transition is rejected so a
//     direct write into `processing/` cannot bypass the inbox.
//   - Processing→consumed transition: a consumed entry that is
//     newly added (not present in the prior tree) must be backed by
//     a processing entry in the prior tree at the same address with
//     the same messageId. The receivedAt and messageId carried in
//     the prior processing envelope must equal the values carried in
//     the new consumed envelope so the audit trail is unambiguous.
//
// Authz:
//   - `hub` principal: full access.
//   - `workflow-process` principal: read/write its own deployment's
//     event log. The principal carries `{ anchorRunId, runId? }`;
//     this handler verifies `repoId.id === anchorRunId`.
//   - `supervisor` principal: read/write its own deployment's event
//     log. The principal carries `{ anchorRunId }`; this handler
//     verifies `repoId.id === anchorRunId`.
//   - `sidecar` principal: read-only (createPack, resolveRef) for
//     resume.
//   - `user` principal: gated by bearer-token claims and the route
//     layer's pre-resolved authz verdict, mirroring the convention
//     used by the other kinds.

 * (connected-window retry and reconnect-redelivery), so an at-least-once

 * refused. A redelivery instead hits the `consumed/`/`processing/`/`inbox/`

 * (old) `receivedAt` back into the queue is `replayProcessingToInbox`, which
 * writes straight to `inbox/` and bypasses the stale gate entirely. So
 * `claim_check_stale_enqueue` is unreachable via redelivery today. If any

 * `enqueueInbox`, stale becomes reachable, the horizon must then be >= that
 * source's maximum redelivery window, and `StaleInboxEnqueueError`'s

// Claim-check API.

// the workflow runtime a FIFO claim-check queue per address:
//
//   enqueueInbox          — append a new inbox entry for an inbound
//                           message.
//   dequeueToProcessing   — pick the lexicographically-first inbox
//                           entry and atomically move it to
//                           processing.
//   markConsumed          — atomically remove the processing entry
//                           and write the canonical
//                           consumed/<messageId>.json dedup index
//                           entry.
//   replayProcessingToInbox — recovery path that moves every
//                           processing entry back to inbox preserving
//                           its `<receivedAt>-<messageId>` filename
//                           key so FIFO ordering survives a crash.
//
// All four route through `writeTreeDelta`, scoped to the per-address
// subtree via `changedPathPrefixes`. The substrate serializes concurrent
// claim-check operations on the per-repo lock and invokes each
// operation's `computeDelta` callback with a `prior` view of the
// committed tree. The callback reads only what it needs directly --
// `prior.listDirOids` for a directory's names and OIDs, and
// `prior.readBlobByOid` for a specific entry's bytes -- and returns a
// TARGETED delta (the `puts` and `deletes` for the paths that change),
// not the full subtree. The substrate applies that delta atomically over
// the prior tree, carrying every untouched entry forward by OID and
// landing the whole delta in a single commit, which is the atomic-commit
// guarantee these operations require.

 * Read the processing-queue entry for `messageId` at `address` without

 * `rawMessage` bytes) or `null` when no processing entry exists for the
 * messageId.
 *
 * This is the read half of mailbox ownership (§3a): the supervisor's
 * dispatch loop moves an inbox entry to processing and forwards a
 * `trigger.fired{messageId}` to the workflow-process child; the child
 * calls this to recover the inbound message bytes that become its step
 * input.
 *
 * The read is a flat working-tree read of
 * `addresses/<seg>/processing/`. The substrate materializes each
 * claim-check commit's touched paths into the repo's working tree (the
 * delta write removes each deleted path and writes each put after
 * validation passes), so a read issued after `dequeueToProcessing`
 * committed -- which is exactly when the supervisor forwards
 * `trigger.fired` -- observes the processing entry. Reading the working tree (rather than walking the
 * committed git tree) matches the workflow-process child's sibling
 * read of `runs/<runId>/events/`. Because the
 * read issues no commit it cannot race the supervisor's `markConsumed`
 * write; it returns a point-in-time snapshot of the directory.
