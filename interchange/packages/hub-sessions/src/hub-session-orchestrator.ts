// Hub-side orchestrator for the sidecar event emitter.

// Subscribes to the sidecar router's events and runs the host-side
// reactions: dispatching inference events to the event collector,
// restoring the event collector on reconnect, re-deploying stale
// agents, and forwarding mail.delivered notifications back to

//
// The orchestrator depends on a narrow `HubSessionRouterFacade` rather
// than the full SidecarRouter, so tests can drive subscriber behavior
// with a small stub and an isolated emitter.
