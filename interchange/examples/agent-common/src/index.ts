// Shared helpers for the agent-* examples.
//
// Every agent-* example needs to build an `InferenceSource` from the
// surrounding environment (so users with an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set can
// just run the binary) while also accepting a `sourceOverride` that
// tests use to bypass the env entirely. Without a common helper each
// example would re-derive the same boilerplate and the failure mode
// (missing env vars) would drift in wording from one example to the
// next.
//
// This package is consumed only by the other examples; it is not part
// of the @intx public surface.
