// workflow-quickstart: run the workflow.
//
// `runLocal` is the in-process host. It supplies the whole
// `WorkflowRuntimeEnv` -- an in-memory event log, blob substrate,
// scheduler and signal channel -- and drives the same runtime body the
// deployed sidecar drives. What a caller has to supply is what the
// definition left as a string or a declaration:
//
//   authorize       -- required, no default. The deployed authorize
//                      refuses to answer when it cannot resolve a
//                      decision; the local surface refuses to invent one.
//   loopFns         -- what the deployed host loads from
//                      `interchange.loops`, resolved by export name.
//   actionResolver  -- what it loads from `interchange.actions`.
//   invokeStep      -- what turns a step's `AgentDefinition` into a
//                      running agent. Without it `runLocal` stubs every
//                      step and no tool is ever called.
