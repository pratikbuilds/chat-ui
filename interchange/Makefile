# The unit pass: parallel-safe tests at the default 5s timeout. Whole

# run in parallel (UNIT_PARALLEL workers); --no-isolate keeps one global and
# module registry per worker across that worker's files, matching the

# @intx/* import cost (with --parallel's default per-file isolation every

# The workflow-deploy integration pass: spawns real hub/sidecar processes
# and drives real agents, so it needs the extended timeout. Split from the
# core pass so CI can run the two heavy passes as separate parallel jobs.
#
# Files run in parallel (WF_PARALLEL workers): each file is fully isolated
# (hub/mocks bind port 0, data dirs are mkdtemp, and every file migrates its
# own unique Postgres schema), so the pass is wall-clock bound by process
# boot and reconnect waits rather than CPU. The default of 4 stays within
# 16GB-RAM guests (worker + sidecar subprocess + workflow-process child per
# file); see WF_PARALLEL above for how to raise it locally. This pass leans
# on polling deadlines carried by the shared fixture helpers, which
# "Synchronizing on State, Not Time" in CONVENTIONS.md rules against and
# which are a backlog to make signal-driven; a failure at a higher worker
# count is one of those tests, not a ceiling. The pinned 3s reconnect is a
# different case and stays -- it drives a production duration through an env
# seam the rest of the suite shortens.
#
# --no-isolate keeps one global and module registry per worker across that
# worker's files, so the large @intx/* module graph is imported once per
# worker instead of re-imported into a fresh isolate per file. Measured on a
# 32-core guest at 4-way parallel: peak RSS drops from ~7.4-7.8GB to
# ~6.3-6.4GB and the pass runs ~12% faster. Files remain runtime-isolated
# (port 0, mkdtemp dirs, unique schemas) and none rely on fresh module state,
# so sharing the registry across files is safe.
